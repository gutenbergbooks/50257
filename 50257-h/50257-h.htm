<br />The Lodge on the Lake</h2>
<p>The battered station wagon bumped and
groaned over the rutted dirt road at about ten
miles per hour, churning up great clouds of dust.
Sandy Steele wiped the grime and grit from his
face with his handkerchief and bent forward to
yell in the driver&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much further, Mr. McClintock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizened little old man tugged his dirty
straw hat down tighter as the front wheels lurched
in and out of a hole with a jolt that sent all four
occupants of the car bouncing several inches off
the seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout &rsquo;nother quarter of a mile is all,&rdquo; the
man finally replied.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned at his high-school friend Jerry
James, seated beside him. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve come
twenty miles; I guess we&rsquo;ll last another fifteen
hundred feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The short, stout boy seated up front with the
driver turned to face them, his eyes owlish behind
thick, horn-rimmed glasses. &ldquo;One thousand, three
hundred and twenty feet, to be precise,&rdquo; he said
solemnly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a quarter of a mile exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry let out long-suffering groans.
At fifteen, Clyde Benson (Quiz) Taylor was the
No. 1 student at Valley View High School in
central California where the three boys lived only
houses apart. At the age of ten, Quiz had been
a winning contestant on a television quiz program,
which accounted for his nickname. Quiz could
discuss Einstein&rsquo;s Theory of Relativity or the
batting averages of the leading hitters in the
National and American Leagues with equal ease.
His mind was a bulging storehouse of facts and
figures that his friends found very valuable. But
at times the superior manner in which he flaunted
his knowledge could be highly irritating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you have to ask him along?&rdquo; Jerry
demanded wearily. &ldquo;Living with Quiz for a whole
month is more than any human being can take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lets you out then, Jerry,&rdquo; Quiz said,
grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, wise guy.&rdquo; Jerry thrust his lantern jaw
out indignantly. &ldquo;Just you wait till we&rsquo;re camping
out in the deep woods&mdash;hundreds of miles from
civilization, with no one around to hear your
deathly screams.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The driver interrupted this byplay, pointing to
a patch of blue between the trunks of the giant
pines. &ldquo;There, you can see the lake now, fellers.
Five minutes more, we&rsquo;ll be at Mr. Steele&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;
He caught Sandy&rsquo;s eye in the rear-view mirror.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Russ Steele&rsquo;s nephew, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver nodded. &ldquo;Great man, Russ Steele.
My son was in his division in Korea. Said General
Steele was the best CO any outfit ever had. Used
to be real interested in his men. My boy said the
dogfaces swore by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Russ is a regular guy all right,&rdquo; Sandy
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; Jerry put in. &ldquo;How many big shots
like him would spend their summer vacations
taking a bunch of teen-agers on a camping trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver looked surprised. &ldquo;Russ never talks
about his work. Is he really a big shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Steele is vice president in charge of research
of World Dynamics Corporation,&rdquo; Quiz
explained loftily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the firm that does all
that secret government work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver tipped back his straw hat. &ldquo;Well,
now, I never would&rsquo;ve guessed it. He sure don&rsquo;t
act it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, the station wagon rounded a
curve, and the road broke out of the trees on the
lake shore. To the left and right, water stretched
away as far as the eye could see. Straight across,
the far shore was barely visible through the blue
haze on the horizon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Jerry whistled in wonder. &ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s a lake?
It looks more like the Pacific Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I remember correctly,&rdquo; Quiz said, &ldquo;the Red
Lake Indian Reservation is somewhere around
here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McClintock nodded. &ldquo;Couple of miles west, on
the lower lake. Actually, there&rsquo;s twin lakes, connected
by sort of a gooseneck. Russ Steele&rsquo;s place
is on the south shore of the upper lake. Here we
are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Set back in an acre of cleared land beyond the
beach was a two-story, rambling lodge with a wide
front porch. The rough, pine log walls were solidly
chinked so that they could withstand the frigid
north Minnesota winters; Russell Steele, an avid
hunter, used the place as often in winter as he did
in summer. A small dock ran out into the lake and
served as a mooring for three rowboats as well as a
16-foot cabin cruiser.</p>
<p>As the station wagon drew up in front of the
porch, a tall, powerful man with broad shoulders
came down the steps to greet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Red Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy leaped out of the car and wrung his
uncle&rsquo;s hand vigorously. &ldquo;Uncle Russ! It&rsquo;s great
to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>A lithe six-footer, Sandy seemed puny beside
the older man. In his plaid shirt and dungarees,
Russell Steele looked more like a lumberjack than
a corporation executive. He shook hands with the
other two boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad the whole gang could make it,&rdquo; Russ said,
grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a peach to invite us, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; Jerry
said.</p>
<p>Russell Steele walked over to the front window
of the station wagon and put one big hand on the
driver&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John McClintock removed his straw hat and
blew the dust off the crown. &ldquo;Not bad, Russ. But
I could use some rain like everybody else around
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad. Very bad. The ground
is like cement and everything is dry as parchment.
I don&rsquo;t mind telling you I&rsquo;m worried, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver shrugged. &ldquo;Like living in a tinder-box.
I hear you&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; these young fellers out
into the deep woods. Better not go too far. We&rsquo;re
just about due for a forest fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Russ promised. He reached
into his pocket and took out a folded ten-dollar
bill. &ldquo;Thanks for bringing the boys out, John.
Here, let me take care of their taxi fare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>John McClintock pushed the extended bill
away firmly. &ldquo;Not on your life, Russ. This one&rsquo;s
on me. I owe you a favor after what you did for my
family last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at Sandy. &ldquo;Last winter when your
uncle was up hunting around my place, my
youngest cut hisself bad on a band saw. Russ hiked
nine miles through a raging blizzard to fetch the
doc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ laughed easily. &ldquo;I needed the exercise,
John. Now you take this money&mdash;&rdquo; But before he
could finish, the old man had gunned the motor
and the station wagon leaped forward. It turned
into the drive, backed around in the road, then
headed off in the direction of town.</p>
<p class="tb">Russ helped the boys carry their luggage into
the lodge and upstairs to their rooms. &ldquo;The bathroom&rsquo;s
at the end of the hall. After you shower,
come down to the porch. I&rsquo;ll have the cook fix you
some lemonade and sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was the first one finished. Russ Steele
looked up and grinned as his nephew appeared in
the doorway, running a comb through his unmanageable
blond hair with dogged determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still having trouble with that cowlick, I see,&rdquo;
Russ said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;m going to get a butch haircut
like Jerry James&rsquo;s. Then all I&rsquo;ll have to do is
run a washrag across it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother will never buy that,&rdquo; Russ
laughed. &ldquo;How are the folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s down in
Mexico for two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ took a long draw on his pipe. &ldquo;On another
one of those government geological expeditions,
I suppose. I envy John, getting to see so much of
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He enjoys it, all right,&rdquo; Sandy admitted. He
looked up as a big, sleek-haired dog came bounding
out of the pines on one side of the house.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Prince, the cook&rsquo;s Doberman pinscher.&rdquo;
Russ whistled softly through his teeth.</p>
<p>The dog&rsquo;s sharp ears and muzzle thrust alertly
into the air; then, with the bounce of a recoiling
spring, he came striding across the sunburned
lawn and cleared the front steps in a single leap,
to squat in front of Russ with his short stub of a
tail wagging vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about jet propulsion!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed.
&ldquo;What do you feed him on?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Russ laughed and leaned over to stroke the
animal&rsquo;s glossy black coat. &ldquo;Pound for pound
the Doberman is the strongest canine bred. One
of the most intelligent, too. We use them as watchdogs
at the plant. I brought this fellow up as a
Christmas present for the cook two years ago.
Prince, meet Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Promptly, the dog turned to Sandy and raised
his right paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Prince,&rdquo; Sandy said solemnly,
taking the paw and shaking it. &ldquo;Say, he is smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Quiz came out on the porch a few
minutes later, and Russ entertained the boys by
putting Prince through some of his tricks. But
the dog was temporarily forgotten when a rangy,
string bean of a man arrived with a huge tray
piled high with sandwiches and a pitcher of
lemonade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Lars Johannsen,&rdquo; Russ introduced him
to the boys. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my cook and caretaker. Lars
used to cook in a lumber camp, so he&rsquo;s used to
chow hounds. Dig in, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johannsen, who had lank blond hair bleached
white by the sun, and a drooping mustache,
flashed a snaggle-toothed grin. &ldquo;Ya, you eat all
you want,&rdquo; he said with just a trace of a Scandinavian
accent. &ldquo;Plenty more to eat in kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to coax me,&rdquo; Jerry said,
grabbing a big, two-inch-thick sandwich in each
hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m famished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they feed you on the plane?&rdquo; Russ
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Sandy told him. &ldquo;We had a big breakfast
just before we landed. But Jerry is the
hungriest man alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he keeps it up, he won&rsquo;t make the football
team this year,&rdquo; Quiz said dryly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be too fat
to bend over to center the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s calling who fat!&rdquo; Jerry spluttered
between mouthfuls. &ldquo;The original blob in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz sniffed. &ldquo;My mother thinks I&rsquo;m perfect
just the way I am. When this baby fat drops off,
I&rsquo;ll have a physique the likes of which you&rsquo;ve never
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> I can believe!&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it up, boys,&rdquo; Russ laughed. &ldquo;After a
month in the woods, you&rsquo;ll both be slim as reeds
and hard as rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we really be camping out for the whole
month?&rdquo; Sandy asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll always be on the move. Of course,
there will be times when we&rsquo;ll stop over at ranger
stations or lumber camps. But for the most part,
we&rsquo;ll be roughing it in the best frontier tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time do we leave?&rdquo; Jerry wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning at six. Packs will be rolled
before we hit the sack tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Packs?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Russell Steele nodded as he relit his pipe with
a long wooden match. &ldquo;A conventional infantryman&rsquo;s pack.
Bedroll, shelter half, tent pegs, mess
kit, raincoat, socks, underwear, spare shirt and
levis, canned goods, K-rations, toothbrush, shaving
kit, trenching tools, and, of course, a canteen
and cup on your belt. We&rsquo;ll split up the larger
utensils&mdash;pots and frying pans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry James jumped up, stood at attention and
threw off a snappy salute. &ldquo;Yes, sir! Hut-two-three-four!
We&rsquo;re in the Army now. We march at
dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ grinned appreciatively; then he said in his
most authoritative, military manner, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just
one thing, soldier. You don&rsquo;t salute with a boloney
sandwich in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER TWO</span>
<br />Into the Woods</h2>
<p>After a pre-dawn breakfast of sausage, eggs and
flapjacks, Russell Steele and the three boys
strapped on their packs and walked down to the
dock where Lars Johannsen was warming up the
cabin cruiser. Prince was running back and forth
on the pier, barking excitedly.</p>
<p>Jerry eased his thumbs under the pack straps
where they cut into his shoulders. &ldquo;Boy, this stuff
is heavy. You mean to say soldiers carry all this
weight for miles and miles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More weight than that,&rdquo; Russ told him. &ldquo;Our
packs don&rsquo;t weigh more than thirty or forty
pounds. An infantryman may pack better than
sixty pounds. And that doesn&rsquo;t include his cartridge
belt and rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for the Navy,&rdquo; Quiz said emphatically.</p>
<p>Russ laughed. &ldquo;After a few days you won&rsquo;t even
realize your pack is there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The sun, a steaming red ball through the morning
mist over the lake, was just showing above the
treetops as they climbed aboard the cruiser. Russ
cast off and the cook advanced the throttle slowly.
With a roar of the twin exhausts, the sleek craft
shot away from the dock, her bow lifting as it
cleaved through the clear, blue water. Prince
scrambled up on the top deck and stood at the
prow, leaning forward into the fine spray whipping
back across the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a fine pair of sea legs,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Two pairs, you mean. He looks
like a figurehead on one of those old sailing ships,
doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ outlined the month&rsquo;s itinerary: &ldquo;Lars will
drop us off at the northeast corner of the lake, and
we&rsquo;ll strike out for Big Falls. From Big Falls we&rsquo;ll
head south to Bow String Lake, and from Bow
String west back to the lodge. Actually, we&rsquo;ll be
traveling in a big triangle, about one hundred and
twenty miles altogether, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a lumber region, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
Quiz asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see lumberjacks
at work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your chance, Quiz,&rdquo; Russ
promised him. &ldquo;Although the lumber industry in
Minnesota is only a shadow of what it used to be.
A little more than a century ago, more than three
quarters of the state was forested. But ruthless
cutting of timber without any thought of conservation
or restocking has all but wiped out the
great pine forests of the Lake States. The short-sighted
men responsible never stopped to consider
how long it takes a tree to grow. Why, some
of these big fellows are mere babies after one
hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little launch was fairly skimming across the
mirror-like surface of the lake now. There wasn&rsquo;t
a hint of a breeze, and although it was still early
morning, the sun burned down so intensely that
they had to string up an awning over the rear
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another scorcher,&rdquo; Russ said grimly.</p>
<p>Lars grunted. &ldquo;We better get rain soon, or we
have pretty big trouble. One spark in these woods
and <i>poof</i>!&rdquo; He threw up his hands.</p>
<p>Russ spoke seriously to the boys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
we&rsquo;re going to have to forgo the joys of the evening
campfire. It would be much too dangerous.
I brought along a Coleman stove to cook on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was disappointed. &ldquo;Heck, that&rsquo;s half the
fun of camping out&mdash;shooting the breeze around
the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel bad about it myself,&rdquo; Russ agreed. &ldquo;But
if you ever had had the misfortune to see a forest
fire at first hand, you&rsquo;d understand that it&rsquo;s out of
the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen one close?&rdquo; Sandy asked
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. Down in Southern California a
couple of years ago. It was the most horrible experience
of my life.&rdquo; He seemed to go tense at
the recollection.</p>
<p>Jerry shivered and gazed intently at the approaching
shoreline; the foliage stretched away unbroken
to the horizon like a roof over the forest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be somewhere in the middle of that
if a fire did break out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have anything to worry about,
as long as we&rsquo;re careful,&rdquo; Russ assured him. &ldquo;And
you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the natives; their
livelihoods&mdash;and lives&mdash;depend on good fire-prevention
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all well and good, sir,&rdquo; Quiz said
somberly, &ldquo;but what about lightning?&rdquo; He studied
the cloudless sky arching all about them like a
pale-blue china bowl. &ldquo;When this hot spell breaks,
you can bet it will break with a ripsnorting
thunder-and-lightning storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cheerful sort,&rdquo; Jerry grumbled.</p>
<p>Russ Steele&rsquo;s brow furrowed in concentration.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good point, Quiz. All we can do is hope
that if lightning does ignite any small fires, a good
rain will follow soon enough to douse them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they have fire spotters in these woods?&rdquo;
Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. The U.S. Forest Service has rangers
stationed in fire towers throughout all critical
areas on twenty-four-hour duty. But there&rsquo;s an
awful lot of territory to cover. Many times a blaze
will be out of control before it&rsquo;s detected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation broke off as the shoreline
loomed up rapidly now. Lars steered the launch
toward a rickety wooden dock before a small frame
bungalow set back about 100 feet from the water&rsquo;s
edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old army buddy of mine owns that camp,&rdquo;
Russ told them. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be up until the hunting
season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Lars maneuvered the launch expertly alongside
the dock, Russ leaped out and gave the mooring
line a few turns around a piling. He lent a
hand to each of the boys in turn as they stepped
up on the gunwale and hopped gingerly across to
the wooden platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These packs throw you off balance,&rdquo; Quiz
grumbled, heading gratefully for solid land.</p>
<p>They all laughed as Prince, who was leaning
far out over the bow watching the fish dart about
in the clear water, lost his footing and went
tumbling into the lake. He surfaced and went
streaking for shore like a seal. The big dog
scrambled out of the lake a few feet away from
Quiz and shook himself vigorously, sending the
spray flying in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Quiz complained, stumbling backward.
&ldquo;Somebody turn off the sprinkler system.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you won&rsquo;t have to take a bath tonight,&rdquo;
Jerry kidded him.</p>
<p>When he was through shaking, Prince sat down
on the bank and watched them with his head
cocked to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he wants to go with us,&rdquo; Sandy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him along,&rdquo; Lars said. &ldquo;The exercise will
do him good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Russ agreed. &ldquo;All right, boy, you
can come with us if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lars gunned the motor and waved. &ldquo;Well, so
long. Have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russell Steele cast off the mooring line. &ldquo;We
will, Lars. And I promise to take good care of
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lars laughed. &ldquo;Prince take good care of you, I
think. See you in couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys watched until the boat was just a
speck in the distance. &ldquo;What a sweet outfit that is,
Mr. Steele,&rdquo; Jerry said admiringly. &ldquo;I could spend
the whole summer just cruising around the lake
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ took out his pipe and filled it from a
plastic pouch. &ldquo;Before you go back to California,
we&rsquo;ll try and get some water skiing in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that will be great.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Russ led the way up the beach to the bungalow.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fill our canteens with fresh water from the
pump behind the house and be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They struck out through a grove of pines with
Russ leading the way. The boles were thick
around as a man and clean of limbs for about
thirty feet up. A dim, soothing green light filtered
down through the interlaced canopy of branches
above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It reminds me of a cathedral,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>The silence was eerie; their footsteps were almost
soundless on the spongy forest floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like walking on cotton,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;This
must be the softest ground in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really not walking on the ground,&rdquo;
Russ said. &ldquo;The duff and humus here must be a
foot thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s duff and humus?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decayed vegetable matter,&rdquo; Quiz translated
promptly. &ldquo;Falling pine needles, scraps of bark,
dead plants and bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they got farther away from the lake, the
matter underfoot began to rustle crisply. A pine
cone fell, rattling through the dry boughs. Russ
glanced up and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it would rain,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>At the end of the first hour, he called a halt.
&ldquo;Ten-minute break.&rdquo; The boys protested that
they weren&rsquo;t tired yet, but he was adamant. &ldquo;If
you walk until you&rsquo;re tired, you won&rsquo;t want to get
up again. A ten-minute break every hour helps
prevent fatigue. And remove your packs. The idea
is to relax completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry sat down with his back to a tree and removed
his left shoe and sock to examine a red welt
on his instep. &ldquo;Gee, I think I&rsquo;m getting a blister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; Russ came over and knelt down by
him. &ldquo;Hmmm, it looks that way.&rdquo; He went to his
pack, got out a first-aid kit and found a Band-aid.</p>
<p>As he applied the little adhesive bandage to the
blister, his eyes fell on Jerry&rsquo;s sock lying on the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a cotton sock?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jerry answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you fellows distinctly to wear wool socks,
didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s face reddened. &ldquo;Yes, but it was so darned
hot that I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; Russ said patiently, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you
to wear wool socks just to make you uncomfortable.
I wanted to save you a lot of agony. If you
keep on wearing those thin socks for a couple of
days, we&rsquo;ll have to carry you back on a stretcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Quiz stood nearby curiously. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
that, Uncle Russ?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;A good pair of heavy wool socks protects your
feet; keeps them dry and won&rsquo;t bunch up in
blister-making creases. Any soldier or woodsman,
anybody who does a lot of hiking, can tell you. In
my old army outfit, wearing cotton socks on a hike
was a punishable offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; Quiz said with relish. &ldquo;I vote we
assign Jerry to permanent KP duty for fouling
things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;I second the motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s lantern jaw sagged. &ldquo;Aw, fellers, have a
heart! General Steele, I appeal to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ laughed. &ldquo;I have to admit that sounds a
trifle severe. Let&rsquo;s compromise. Jerry, you can
consider yourself on special detail for one night.
All the mess kits and pans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry relaxed against his tree. &ldquo;Whew! That
was close. I thought for a while you were going
to court-martial me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for it,&rdquo; Quiz said testily. &ldquo;Personally
speaking, I think you ought to face a firing squad.&rdquo;
He ducked as Jerry let a pine cone fly at his head.</p>
<p>Prince went running after the cone, retrieved
it and dropped it in Jerry&rsquo;s lap. The boy scowled
at the others as he scratched the big dog behind
the ears. &ldquo;At least I have one friend in the crowd,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER THREE</span>
<br />A Midnight Visitor</h2>
<p>At noon they stopped in a small clearing for a
quick K-ration lunch. The boys were intrigued
by the contents of the oblong, waxed-cardboard
boxes.</p>
<p>Jerry announced the articles as he removed
them. &ldquo;Biscuits, fig bar, instant coffee, sugar, a can
of cheese and bacon&mdash;say, who ever said the army
eats bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russell Steele placed a pot of water on the Coleman
stove. &ldquo;Nobody ever said the army eats bad.
Matter of fact, it eats darn good. There&rsquo;s nothing
wrong with K-rations, except that a steady diet
of them can get monotonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were finished eating, Sandy and
Jerry scooped out a deep hole in the forest floor
with their shovels and buried the garbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, I&rsquo;d prefer to burn it,&rdquo; Russ told
them, &ldquo;but a fire is out of the question now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>They resumed walking until about four-thirty,
when Russ consulted the walk-o-meter strapped
to his leg. &ldquo;Well, we made fifteen miles today.
That&rsquo;s not bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call it a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz groaned as he dropped his pack to the
ground. &ldquo;I am so pooped, I could crawl into my
bedroll right this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without supper?&rdquo; Jerry asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ frowned. &ldquo;None of that, Quiz. You&rsquo;ve got
to eat, even if you have to force every mouthful
down. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll be weak as a cat tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked around at the tall trees towering
over them like giants with their arms outstretched.
A chill ran along his spine. &ldquo;Have you ever
noticed how nature seems to work against you
when you&rsquo;re out in the wilderness like this? It&rsquo;s
constantly playing tricks on you. Like Quiz being
too tired to eat, or people falling asleep in the
snow and freezing to death. All your instincts
seem to be wrong. It&rsquo;s scary, sort of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Russell Steele nodded soberly. &ldquo;The Indians
used to say that the wilderness spirits resented the
intrusion of the white man because he came to
destroy the forests and the wild beasts. They attributed
all kinds of devilment to the spirits.
Whenever a white man was lost in the woods,
mauled by a bear, injured by a falling tree or
struck by lightning, the tribal medicine men
would nod their heads wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathen superstition,&rdquo; Quiz sniffed.</p>
<p>Jerry looked around nervously. &ldquo;Not so loud,
huh. Just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and his uncle laughed. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Russ said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the folklore for one day. Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They camped in a small clearing on the bank
of a stream, which Russ said had once been a
raging torrent. Now, only a thin rivulet of water
trickled through the rocky bed. Russ scooped out
a hollow where the water flowed between two
boulders, to form a small pool, so that they were
able to wash up and fill their canteens.</p>
<p>Supper consisted of canned beans, bacon and
pan-fried biscuits. Everyone ate heartily, with the
exception of Prince, who turned up his nose at the
conglomeration of food they piled up on a tin
plate for him and stalked off into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably off to catch himself a rabbit,&rdquo; Russ
said.</p>
<p>Jerry wrinkled up his nose distastefully. &ldquo;And
I thought he was a nice dog. That&rsquo;s cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dope,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;Is it any more
cruel than slaughtering cows, pigs, sheep and little
lambs to feed our faces?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Animals are nicer than people,&rdquo; Quiz said.
&ldquo;They only kill each other for food. It&rsquo;s the
beautiful balance of nature. The fish and birds eat
the insects; and they in turn provide food for the
larger animals. Every living thing has its place and
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even snakes?&rdquo; Jerry asked, suddenly scanning
the ground suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the snakes,&rdquo; Quiz said.</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so worried, Jerry.
They won&rsquo;t bother you unless you bother them
first. I read it in a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;But how do I know the
snakes around here read the same book?&rdquo; He
grinned as the other two boys moaned and rocked
back and forth with their heads in their hands.
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> bad, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ put down his empty dish and began to
fill his pipe. &ldquo;I think a joke like that rates KP
for another night, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Quiz helped Jerry clear up the mess
kits, forks and pans and carry them down to the
pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Sandy remembered suddenly, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t
bring any soap powder. How can he wash these
greasy things in cold water without a strong soap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could boil some water,&rdquo; Quiz suggested.</p>
<p>Russ got up from where he was relaxing against
a tree and joined them. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
sand?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sand!&rdquo; the boys chorused together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s the best detergent there is. Mix up
some of that fine sand on the bank with a little
water and you&rsquo;ll get these utensils as sparkling
clean as your mothers&rsquo; best silverware.&rdquo; He turned
away, shaking his head. &ldquo;Fine lot of woodsmen
we&rsquo;d be, going camping with a case of soap powder
and steel wool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jerry was finishing up the dishes, Russell
Steele showed Sandy and Quiz how to erect the
pup tents. &ldquo;Each of us has a shelter half in his bedroll,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;Half of a tent, to be exact,
with enough wooden pegs to anchor it to the
ground. We also have one ridgepole apiece. When
we pair off, we have the makings for a complete
tent; that&rsquo;s how they do it in the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the creek, Jerry yelled, &ldquo;What happens if
there&rsquo;s one guy left over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ laughed. &ldquo;He stands first tour of guard
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The sky was still light when they crawled into
their bedrolls. Sandy and his uncle shared one
tent, and Quiz and Jerry the other.</p>
<p>Jerry sighed contentedly as he lay back. &ldquo;I
must be tired. This old ground feels like a feather
mattress to my weary bones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; Sandy called from the other
tent, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re lying on a bed of duff and pine
needles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys are crazy,&rdquo; Quiz grumbled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
okay if you lie flat, I guess. But I can only sleep
on my side. What are you supposed to do with
your hips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for being so fat,&rdquo; Jerry
chortled gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try scooping out a hole for your hip to fit
into,&rdquo; Russ suggested.</p>
<p>Quiz unzipped his sleeping bag and sat up.
Working with his fingers, he shaped a small
hollow in the soft duff, then settled down again.
&ldquo;Ahhh, that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he said with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Jerry gloated, &ldquo;there are some things
you can&rsquo;t learn in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; Quiz mumbled.</p>
<p>Before Sandy dropped off to sleep, he heard
Prince return to camp. The big Doberman took a
long drink from the creek and then settled down
in front of the tent at Russell Steele&rsquo;s feet. His
presence there gave Sandy a feeling of warm comfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>It seemed to Sandy that he had just closed his
eyes when the noise of voices, barking and the
pounding of his own heart jolted him out of a
deep sleep. For a moment he lay there, paralyzed
by terror. He opened his eyes, then shut them
quickly as a blinding spot of light knifed painfully
into his optic nerves. He had caught a fleeting
glimpse of his uncle sitting up and clinging to
Prince&rsquo;s collar with one hand.</p>
<p>With the full return of consciousness, Sandy
could make out a strange voice talking earnestly
and urgently to Russell Steele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... they&rsquo;ve been on your trail since noon,
General Steele. The Forest Service has had every
ranger in the district looking for you. I spotted
your dog from my fire tower about eight o&rsquo;clock
and started to follow him. Of course, he lost me
pretty quick, but I knew you had to be somewhere
in the vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like finding a needle in a haystack,&rdquo; Russell
Steele said. &ldquo;You must know these woods, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fire tower is about five miles from here.
I&rsquo;ll take you there and we can radio headquarters.
They&rsquo;ll hook you up direct with Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shading his eyes against the light, Sandy sat
up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Uncle Russ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sandy, you&rsquo;re awake. Good. We&rsquo;ll have to
break camp immediately. The Pentagon has been
trying to get in touch with me. Very urgent. This
is Dick Fellows, Sandy; he&rsquo;s a U.S. Forest Ranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Sandy said, squinting at the young man
who was crouched in front of their tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The ranger touched two fingers to his stiff-brimmed
hat and grinned. &ldquo;Sorry to disturb your
sleep. You guys must be plenty tired if this is your
first day on the trail.&rdquo; He stretched out one hand
toward Prince, who was still growling suspiciously
deep in his throat. &ldquo;Your friend here doesn&rsquo;t trust
midnight visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ released his grip on the dog&rsquo;s collar and
gave him a light smack on the rump. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all
right, now that he knows you&rsquo;re not an enemy.
He wouldn&rsquo;t have attacked you, in any case, unless
you pulled a knife or a gun. Prince has been
trained to hold his quarry at bay until help arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy climbed out of his bedroll. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better
go wake up the rest of the gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of the gang is already awake,&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s
voice sang out from the darkness, &ldquo;lying here
quivering with our blankets pulled over our
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz Taylor crawled out of the tent on his
hands and knees, fumbling in his breast pocket for
his eyeglass case. &ldquo;This moron got it into his thick
head that we were being attacked by Indians from
the reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Fellows laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s partly right at that,
I guess. My grandpaw was a pure-blood Dakota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russell Steele struggled into his boots. &ldquo;Well,
suppose you escort us back to your tepee, chief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER FOUR</span>
<br />The Missing A-Bomb</h2>
<p>They reached the ranger fire station shortly after
three in the morning. It was a tower of tubular
steel reaching over one hundred feet into the air.
Jerry craned his neck at the small cabin perched
on top of it, a boxlike silhouette against the brilliant
starlit sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>live</i> up there?&rdquo; he asked the ranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way up the flight of steel stairs that
ran around the outside of the tower. When they
reached the platform at the top, Jerry looked
down and grabbed frantically at the guard railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yipes! I can&rsquo;t even see the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The ranger pushed the door open, flicked on a
wall switch, and a pale amber light bulb flashed
on in the middle of the ceiling. Sandy realized
that the one-roomed structure was larger than it
had appeared from the ground. There was a
double-decker wooden bunk against one wall, a
comfortable-looking leather easy chair in the
nearest corner, and three straight-back wooden
chairs. The wall opposite the bed was occupied by
a sprawling table; most of the table was taken up
by a huge topographic map, dotted with colored
pins. A compass and a variety of other instruments
were scattered over the table. An impressive short-wave
radio rig sat in one corner. The other
furnishings included a small refrigerator, a foot
locker and a bookcase. The four walls were solid
plate glass from waist-height to ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all right,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;d give
plenty to have a little hideaway like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz walked across to the well-stocked bookcase
and examined the titles. &ldquo;What a wonderful place
to read and study,&rdquo; he said enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has its advantages,&rdquo; the ranger admitted.
&ldquo;But it sure gets lonely at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time Sandy had got a good look
at Dick Fellows. He was a pleasant-faced young
man with straight black hair, piercing eyes and an
aquiline nose. He wore the brown uniform of the
Forest Service and heavy storm boots.</p>
<p>Quiz walked to one of the big picture windows
and peered out. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Light reflection,&rdquo; the ranger explained, and
flicked off the wall switch, plunging the room into
darkness. Immediately, the broad canopy of the
forest leaped into prominence, stretching away on
all sides beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a view!&rdquo; Sandy breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see it in the daylight,&rdquo; Dick
Fellows told him. He turned the light on again
and went across to the radio gear. &ldquo;Have you ever
worked one of these things, General Steele?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russell Steele grinned. &ldquo;I had one of the first
ham licenses in this country, young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good; I&rsquo;ll contact headquarters and turn it
over to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russell Steele looked slightly embarrassed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;ll have to ask all of you to step outside
until I find out what this is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; the ranger said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the
boys downstairs and give them a lecture on
forestry.&rdquo; He flicked on the switch and picked up
the transmitting mike, twirling dials with his free
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;KYAT calling KVK.... Fire station KYAT
calling headquarters.... Come in, KVK....&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as contact had been established, Russell
Steele slipped into the operator&rsquo;s chair and put
on the earphones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The ranger and the boys made the long descent
to the ground, where Prince was waiting patiently
at the foot of the stairs. He wagged his tail and
rubbed against them when they patted him, but
occasionally he would whimper and glance up
anxiously at the top of the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wondering what happened to Uncle
Russ,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>Jerry followed the dog&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of
curious to know what gives up there, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Fellows held up his hand, motioning for
silence. &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The boys stopped talking and listened. Faintly
from the northwest there came a distant rumble
of thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll get some rain,&rdquo; Sandy said hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; the ranger said. &ldquo;And pray that
it isn&rsquo;t just a lightning storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you stay up all night looking for fires?&rdquo;
Quiz inquired. &ldquo;In bad seasons like this, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I do, when there&rsquo;s been a lot of
lightning striking in my sector. Most nights I set
my alarm clock to wake me up every few hours
or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live up here all year?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we only man these watchtowers during the
fire season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you get food and water?&rdquo; Sandy
wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a stream just a few hundred yards
back, and I get my supplies by packhorse from
headquarters.&rdquo; Dick Fellows went on to describe
the fascinating life of a forest ranger.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes later, Russ hailed them
from the top of the tower. &ldquo;All clear. Come on up,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Sandy stepped into the observation
room, he knew that whatever had transpired between
his uncle and the Pentagon had been very
serious. Russell Steele&rsquo;s face was gray beneath its
tan, and it was the first time in Sandy&rsquo;s memory
that he had ever looked his age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble, Uncle Russ?&rdquo; he asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>Russ nodded. &ldquo;Bad trouble. The very worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you can tell us what it is, sir?&rdquo;
Dick Fellows said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it is top secret&mdash;for as long as it&rsquo;s possible
to keep it that way.&rdquo; Russ Steele seemed to
be struggling with a problem. &ldquo;Still&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
to need all the help I can get. And we&rsquo;re so isolated
here that there&rsquo;s not much chance of a leak, even
if you were inclined to blab about it. Which I
know you wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he added hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my word, sir,&rdquo; the ranger said
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ours,&rdquo; the boys chorused soberly.</p>
<p>There was a glint of determination in the older
man&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Good. I think you can help. You&rsquo;re
all familiar with the Strategic Air Command,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;SAC Never Sleeps!&rdquo; Quiz recited the slogan of
the famous Air Force arm. &ldquo;Their bombers are in
the air twenty-four hours a day. If the United
States was ever attacked, SAC stratojet bombers
armed with A-bombs would be on their way to
knock out vital targets in the enemy&rsquo;s homeland
within seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty accurate,
Quiz. The Strategic Air Command is the watchdog
of our borders. Now, for an outfit that is literally
flying twenty-four hours a day, their safety
record is amazing; statistics show that a man is
safer riding in an SAC bomber than he is driving
in the family car.&rdquo; The muscles tightened across
his prominent cheekbones. &ldquo;But accidents do
happen. And last night a B-52 stratofortress had a
serious accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard about that on the radio,&rdquo; Dick Fellows
cut in. &ldquo;It crashed somewhere in Manitoba, Canada.
All the crew were killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only part of the story,&rdquo; Russ went on.
&ldquo;The last radio report from the bomber placed it
over Lake Superior. There was a small fire aboard,
but the radio operator thought they had it under
control. Shortly after that their transmitter conked
out. The Air Force never heard from them again&mdash;ship
blew up in the air just south of White
Mouth Lake on the Canadian border.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Sandy and the others listened in shocked silence
as he continued: &ldquo;Most of the wreckage has been
recovered&mdash;and the bodies of the crew.&rdquo; He paused
dramatically. &ldquo;But there is absolutely no trace of
the A-bomb they were carrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Fellows let out a long whistle of astonishment.
&ldquo;What happened to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. The most logical theory is that
they jettisoned the bomb when the fire began to
get out of control. Over some desolate area. It
could have been dumped almost anywhere between
Lake Superior and the scene of the explosion.
Search teams have been out scouring the
most populated areas since dawn yesterday; they&rsquo;re
the critical points. Not that there&rsquo;s any danger of
the bomb detonating, but a thing like this could
cause a lot of hysteria. Then there&rsquo;s the matter of
secrecy.&rdquo; He grinned wryly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do for
the wrong kind of people to find it&mdash;the kind who
would put up a tent around it and sell tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz frowned. &ldquo;If the bomb casing is cracked
or otherwise mutilated, wouldn&rsquo;t there be some
danger from radioactivity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele regarded the boy solemnly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
prefer not to discuss that aspect right now, Quiz.
We won&rsquo;t be in any danger searching for it, I can
tell you that much. The Air Force is going to
drop us a couple of Geiger counters from a helicopter
tomorrow morning. So we&rsquo;ll have ample
warning if we approach an area contaminated by
radioactivity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Quiz Taylor&rsquo;s eyes were enormous behind his
thick glasses. &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re</i> going to look for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the call from the Pentagon was
all about. They knew I was up here and they want
me to take charge of the search operation in this
area. We won&rsquo;t have any help from the military
until the more densely populated areas have a
clean bill of health, but we&rsquo;ll do the best we can
in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Dick Fellows. &ldquo;Ranger headquarters
are advising all fire stations within a
forty-mile radius to clear the woods of campers,
fishermen and sight-seers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You folks are the only party I&rsquo;ve seen in my
sector in weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. And now I&rsquo;d suggest that we all get to
bed for what&rsquo;s left of the night. Tomorrow will be
a rough day.&rdquo; He glanced at their packs piled up
in the middle of the room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of
room for us to spread our sleeping bags on the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take my bunk, sir,&rdquo; the ranger said
quickly.</p>
<p>Russ smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty generous of you,
Dick, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. I&rsquo;ve imposed on
you enough for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>When his four guests were settled in their bedrolls,
the ranger turned out the lights and scanned
the surrounding woods carefully from all four
windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;ll keep till morning,&rdquo; he said wearily,
as he stretched out on his bunk.</p>
<p>Just before he fell off to sleep, Sandy was aware
of a tremendous luminous flash in the sky to the
northwest. &ldquo;Heat lightning,&rdquo; he heard the ranger
mumble, but he was too exhausted to worry about
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER FIVE</span>
<br />Lightning Strikes</h2>
<p>The storm hit with the suddenness and impact
of an earthquake at 6:00 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> An ear-splitting
crash sent the five sleepers jerking up like jack-in-the-boxes.
On all sides of the tower the sky was
alive with jagged streaks of lightning. The
thunder rolled through the air in continuous
waves, shaking the earth. The tower creaked and
trembled violently. Sandy saw a pair of binoculars
on the table dance crazily over the edge and crash
to the floor.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows leaped out of his bunk in T-shirt
and shorts and swept the other instruments off the
table. &ldquo;A couple of you up here!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;The rest of you pile onto chairs or my bunk.
Insulated glass legs. Save your life if the tower&rsquo;s
hit. Keep your feet off the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy kicked out of his bedroll and scrambled
up on the table. Jerry and Quiz dove headlong
onto the bunk. In a more leisurely fashion, Russ
Steele and the ranger sat down on high stools.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>They had just settled themselves when they
were blinded by a tremendous ball of blue fire
that shimmered in mid-air just outside the north
window. An instant later, they were deafened by
an explosion that sounded like the end of the
world. The tower bucked madly, and Sandy was
sure it was going to topple over or collapse.
Gradually his vision cleared to reveal the most
terrifying sight that he had ever witnessed in his
entire life. The whole room was full of tiny blue
sparks that sizzled as they ran in chains across the
icebox and stove and along the metal strips of
molding that trimmed the edges of the floor and
ceiling. Everything metal was encircled by a
sparkling halo. He could scarcely believe his eyes
when he looked at the other people in the room.
Quiz Taylor&rsquo;s long hair was standing up perfectly
straight on his head like a brush; the same was
true of his uncle and Dick Fellows. His own scalp
tingled strangely, and he could feel it bristle. Only
Jerry&rsquo;s close crew-cut was unaffected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; the ranger said calmly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger as long as you sit tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Quiz said brightly. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this for the world.&rdquo; He
grinned as he touched a hand to his hair. &ldquo;A fascinating
phenomenon of static electricity. Those
sparks, too; they&rsquo;re harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;You and your education!&rdquo; Jerry moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
petrified. Say, how long do these things last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranger shrugged. &ldquo;Hard to say. Maybe ten
minutes; maybe an hour.&rdquo; His face was grave
with concern. &ldquo;And every minute it lasts increases
the chance of one of those bolts starting a fire. If
only it would rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy suddenly remembered the dog, who had
remained below on the ground. &ldquo;Poor Prince. I
wonder how he&rsquo;s taking this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranger smiled. &ldquo;Unless I miss my guess,
he&rsquo;s holed up under my dynamo shack out back&mdash;along
with an assortment of rabbits, squirrels
and chipmunks. There&rsquo;s nothing like a little
lightning to make buddies out of natural enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I was with him,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;instead of
sitting on top of this giant lightning rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly it began to rain, a driving downpour,
and miraculously, it seemed to Sandy, the lightning
stopped. The boys began to cheer and
crowded against the windows, watching the drops
pelt the treetops below. But their elation didn&rsquo;t
last very long. In less than five minutes, the rain
ceased, as if a giant sprinkler had been turned off.
Within a quarter of an hour, the clouds disappeared
and the sun beamed through. Thin
wisps of steam began to rise from the leaves, giving
the illusion that the entire forest was smoking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Dick Fellows slouched despondently on his
stool. &ldquo;I knew it. Not even enough to moisten the
ground. And God knows what that lightning
started. A couple of good bolts hit trees; I could
hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy scanned the woods to the horizon on all
sides. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything to worry about. No
fire, no smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple,&rdquo; the ranger told him. &ldquo;A
fire may be burning for days before it&rsquo;s even detected,
particularly in stands of conifers&mdash;pines,
spruce, et cetera&mdash;where the duff is thick. For example,
suppose one of those lightning bolts struck
a snag&mdash;a dead tree&mdash;all dry and punky like those
sticks the kids light fireworks with. Maybe there&rsquo;s
a single spark smoldering deep down in the trunk,
below the surface. Maybe it&rsquo;s as big around as a
pea today; tomorrow it may be the size of a penny.
It&rsquo;s got plenty of time&mdash;and lots of fuel. Slowly it
will spread, eating up through the duff until it
reaches the surface. Now, it&rsquo;s really ready to go,
once it hits the open air and has all that lovely
litter on the forest floor to feed on. If we&rsquo;re lucky,
we&rsquo;ll spot it now because of the smoke.&rdquo; He stared
out grimly across the trees. &ldquo;With everything so
dry, we&rsquo;d have to be real lucky to control it before
it blazes up in the brush and crowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crowns?&rdquo; Jerry said doubtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Burns through the top of the trees,&rdquo; Quiz explained,
&ldquo;in the foliage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>real</i> trouble,&rdquo; the ranger said. He
turned to Russ Steele. &ldquo;Gee, sir, I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t
be able to help you out today. I&rsquo;m going to have
to stay rooted up here for the next twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; Russ said. &ldquo;First things first.
A forest fire at this time could really complicate
my problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed. &ldquo;What would happen
if that missing A-bomb was smack in the middle of
a raging forest fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele looked vaguely troubled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know for sure. Probably nothing. It would depend
on a great many factors. I&rsquo;m not anxious to
find out, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drone of a plane motor suddenly drew
their attention to the east window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a helicopter!&rdquo;
Quiz said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Russ said, heading for the door.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had they reached the ground than
Prince came crawling out from under a small shed
at the edge of the clearing, barking happily and
leaping all over Russ Steele. Russ scratched his
head, chuckling. &ldquo;Dick had you pegged dead to
rights, you old coward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Jerry knelt down solemnly and held out his
right hand to the dog. &ldquo;Shake, old buddy. Us
cowards have to stick together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys waved as the big chopper began to
circle the tower in tightening circles, losing altitude
until it was almost level with the observation
booth. Slowly it cut speed, until at last it
seemed to be hanging motionless in space, held
aloft by the great whirling rotors. A hatch opened
in the bottom of the fuselage, and a crate was let
down carefully on the end of a cable. Before it
could touch the ground, Russ Steele rushed over
and grabbed it, bringing the fragile package gently
to earth. Quickly, he unhooked the cable and
waved up at the helicopter. The cable was reeled
in smoothly, then with a roar of its engines, the
copter leaped into the air. Minutes later it disappeared
over the treetops.</p>
<p>The boys watched with interest as Russ Steele
unpacked the carton and removed two oblong
black Bakelite boxes from the packing. They had
a very unscientific, unprepossessing appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all a Geiger counter is?&rdquo; Jerry said with
a trace of disappointment. &ldquo;The transformer on
my old electric trains looks more complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ smiled. &ldquo;The Geiger counter is very simple,
Jerry&mdash;especially when you consider how delicate
it is and what it can accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;We made one in the science lab once,&rdquo; Quiz
said eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just two electrodes, really. One
of the electrodes is a thin metal cylinder; the other
is a metal wire enclosed in a glass tube filled with
gas&mdash;like a neon light. When the counter is
brought near any radioactive substance, the rays
given off ionize the gas&mdash;so it can conduct electricity&mdash;allowing
the current to jump the gap and
close the circuit, the same way it does when you
switch on a light&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only instead of a light, it activates an audible
indicator,&rdquo; Russ said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <i>clack-clack</i> you
hear when the counter detects radioactivity. Look
how sensitive it is.&rdquo; He held one of the black
boxes near his wrist watch, and it began to chatter
vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy cow!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed, leaping backward.</p>
<p>Russ laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the infinitesimal grain
of radium in the luminous dial. So, you can feel
secure that it will warn us if we enter an area
where there&rsquo;s any unusual radioactivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rummaged around in the carton and pulled
out two canvas straps. &ldquo;These hook on the ends
so the counter can be slung across your shoulder
like a camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince came over and sniffed suspiciously at the
plastic boxes. &ldquo;Nothing to eat there, feller,&rdquo; Sandy
told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eat! That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
famished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz was disgusted. &ldquo;Only Jerry could think
of food at a time like this. Who cares about eating
when there&rsquo;s an A-bomb lying right at your door-step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope <i>not</i>,&rdquo; Jerry said, looking around with
an expression of exaggerated horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Russ said firmly. &ldquo;The first
order of the day is to pack away a substantial
breakfast. We may be tramping through the
woods until dark. Let&rsquo;s go upstairs and see what
Ranger Fellows has cooking.&rdquo; He gathered up the
two Geiger counters and walked to the tower.</p>
<p>Prince whined reprovingly as they left him at
the foot of the steps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you down a bowl
of chow right away,&rdquo; Sandy promised.</p>
<p>They were halfway up the stairs when a sudden
thought struck Jerry. &ldquo;Say, Mr. Steele, what
would happen if one of those big lightning bolts
hit that atomic bomb square on the nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele&rsquo;s face contracted in a sour grimace.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. And stop trying to spoil my appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER SIX</span>
<br />A Futile Search</h2>
<p>Immediately after breakfast, they set out north
from the ranger station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in three days,&rdquo; Russ Steele told
Dick Fellows. &ldquo;Using your station as a base, we&rsquo;re
going to cover all the territory between the Black
River and the Rapid River, from Red Lake to the
Canadian border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; the ranger said. &ldquo;I hope I can be
of some help to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ shook the young man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You have
already, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they started through the woods, with Prince
crashing through the underbrush ahead of them,
Sandy was pessimistic. &ldquo;How much ground do we
have to cover, Uncle Russ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and twenty square miles or
thereabouts. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so hopeless,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;I read in the
paper about an airplane that crashed in the north
woods with three men aboard and they didn&rsquo;t find
it for four months. A bomb&mdash;even an A-bomb&mdash;must
be considerably smaller than a two-engine
plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ nodded grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big order, all right.
But don&rsquo;t forget, there are, or soon will be,
hundreds of teams like ours, each covering an
assigned sector. If we&rsquo;re all thorough and painstaking,
we&rsquo;ll find the bomb sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about air patrols, General Steele?&rdquo; Quiz
asked. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t the Air Force retrace the route
of the B-52 with another plane? Maybe they could
spot the bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele jerked his thumb up at the sky as a
wedge of pursuit ships droned overhead. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
been doing that for two days, but it&rsquo;s a long shot.
First of all, no one knows precisely what route
that big bomber was flying after the radio conked
out. Secondly, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to spot objects
from the air, especially in heavily forested country
like this. An object can drop through this
thick canopy of foliage and leave no more trace
than if it had fallen into the ocean. No, I&rsquo;m afraid
this is a job for the foot soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;FOR-ward MARCH!&rdquo; Jerry bellowed in a
good imitation of a drill sergeant. &ldquo;Hut-two-three-four....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Russ laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this operation calls
for a loose formation, Jerry. Suppose we maintain
an interval of about fifteen hundred feet between
each two men. That will keep us within easy hailing
distance of each other. I&rsquo;ll be on the right flank
with one of the Geiger counters. You boys can
draw lots to see who takes the left flank with the
other counter.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;That poor guy will
have to walk a little more than a mile before we
even get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the fall guy,&rdquo; Sandy volunteered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in better shape than Jerry or Quiz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry sniffed. &ldquo;Show-off! But I&rsquo;m not proud,&rdquo; he
added hastily. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled, then,&rdquo; Russ said. &ldquo;Our direction
will be due north. You all have compasses;
check them regularly. All right, we may as well get
started.&rdquo; He unstrapped the walk-o-meter from
his leg and handed it to Sandy. &ldquo;You better take
this to pace off the intervals. Quiz, Jerry and I will
wait until you&rsquo;ve reached your position. Then
you sing out and the boys will pass the word down
the line. If any of you see anything unusual, sound
off and sit tight until I get there.&rdquo; He pointed to
the black box Sandy had slung over one shoulder.
&ldquo;And if that Geiger counter begins to chatter,
backtrack fast until it stops.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Time passed quickly for Sandy. He was a little
lonely at first, but it didn&rsquo;t last long. There were
so many fascinating things to be seen in the forest
when you were alert, he realized. Chipmunks and
squirrels spied on him from tree hollows. He
passed within two feet of a rabbit burrowed into a
pile of leaves. A lizard that blended so perfectly
into the bark of a tree that it was invisible from
more than twelve inches away didn&rsquo;t loose its rigidity,
even when he touched its tail. After the
first hour, Prince came bounding through the
brush to keep him company. An hour later, the
dog went off to join somebody else. At regular
intervals, the boys would call out to each other,
though an attempt by Sandy and Jerry to keep up
a running conversation soon left both of them
hoarse. They had no chance to get bored. The
enormity and excitement of the mission they were
performing saw to that.</p>
<p>At noon, Russ Steele called a halt for lunch.
&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; he called to Quiz. &ldquo;Break
out a K-ration. Pass the word on to Jerry and
Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Five hours later, they rendezvoused on the
banks of a small river. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp here for tonight,&rdquo;
Russ said. &ldquo;We should make the Canadian
border sometime tomorrow afternoon. There&rsquo;s a
logging camp up there, Quiz, so you&rsquo;ll get a chance
to see lumberjacks at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m still alive,&rdquo; Quiz said wearily. &ldquo;I feel
as if I&rsquo;d walked a hundred miles today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Russ grinned. &ldquo;Not quite. Maybe twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry looked up from a heaping mess kit of beef
stew. &ldquo;Twenty miles! Say, that&rsquo;s pretty good. Bet
you never figured you&rsquo;d ever be walking that far,
eh, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say.&rdquo; Sandy, who had removed his shoes
and socks, lifted one bare foot and blew on it.
&ldquo;The soles of my feet feel all puffed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you go to bed soak them in the river,&rdquo;
his uncle told him. &ldquo;Matter of fact, we can all
use a good bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had finished eating, the boys teamed
up to wash the mess kits and pans. Then they
stripped off their clothes on the river bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last one in gets KP tomorrow night,&rdquo; Russ
said. He dove off a small bluff, cleaving the water
in a perfect racing dive. Prince was right at his
heels, yelping excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that dog sure loves to swim,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>Russ surfaced and flicked water at the Doberman
with the back of his hand. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a regular
porpoise. Come on in, boys; it&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy walked gingerly down the steep bank and
stepped into knee-deep water. &ldquo;Wow, is it cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sissy,&rdquo; Jerry laughed and went splashing past
him. &ldquo;Yipes! It&rsquo;s ice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t kick it all over me!&rdquo; Sandy roared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Quiz gritted his chattering teeth. &ldquo;The only
way to get into ice water is <i>fast</i>.&rdquo; He belly-whopped
between Jerry and Sandy, spraying them
from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sneak,&rdquo; Jerry gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s duck him.&rdquo; He
dove in after Quiz.</p>
<p>After a few minutes they began to enjoy their
bath thoroughly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so cold,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>Jerry flopped on his back and blew a stream of
water into the air like a whale. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just too
numb to feel it. Look, I&rsquo;m turning blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. It feels like heaven after hiking
twenty miles through the woods with the temperature
at an even hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ swam over to them. &ldquo;How do you know it
was a hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a thermometer,&rdquo; Quiz told him. &ldquo;In
the little glade where I ate lunch, it was one
hundred degrees Fahrenheit at a quarter past
twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ gazed somberly toward the forest. &ldquo;If it
doesn&rsquo;t rain soon&mdash;well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A purple twilight was settling rapidly over the
river as they toweled their bodies briskly and
dressed. By the time they finished putting up the
pup tents, it was dark. But even darkness brought
little relief from the heat that night. And the air
was alive with mosquitoes, a few of which managed
to penetrate the netting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to get any rest?&rdquo; Jerry
groaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot to climb into our sleeping
bags and if we lie on top of &rsquo;em we&rsquo;ll be eaten
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz sat up and searched through his pack. &ldquo;I
considered this eventuality.&rdquo; He held up a small
aerosol bomb. &ldquo;DDT. Shut your eyes and hold
your breath for a minute, Jerry.&rdquo; He pointed it
up in the air and pressed down the button until
the little enclosure was thick with white mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always knew you were a genius, Quiz,&rdquo; Sandy
yelled over from the other tent. &ldquo;How about lending
it to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help yourself.&rdquo; Quiz reached under the netting
and rolled it over to his friend.</p>
<p>Jerry sighed blissfully as Quiz lay back. &ldquo;That
did the trick, Quiz, old boy. You sure saved the
day&mdash;the night, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz grumbled as he rolled over on his side. &ldquo;If
I had <i>really</i> been smart, I would have brought
along an inflatable mattress.&rdquo; But two minutes
later he was asleep.</p>
<p class="tb">The new day dawned as bright and hot as the
previous one. They broke camp shortly after 8:00
<span class="sc">A.M.</span> and resumed their trek north at the same
500-yard intervals. The morning passed uneventfully.</p>
<p>At noon, Sandy relayed a question down the
line to his uncle: &ldquo;When do we eat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Russ Steele asked the boys whether they could
hold out for another hour. &ldquo;I think we can make
the logging camp,&rdquo; he explained. A chorus of
&ldquo;ayes&rdquo; answered him.</p>
<p>Shortly after one o&rsquo;clock, Sandy heard a loud
crash in the distance. Right after that Russ Steele
rallied the boys around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re approaching the logging camp,&rdquo; he told
them. &ldquo;That noise you just heard was a tree being
felled. Sandy, we&rsquo;d better get these Geiger
counters out of sight. No use inviting a lot of
questions that we can&rsquo;t answer. We&rsquo;ll wrap them
up in our shelter halves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that had been taken care of, Russ led
the way forward. Gradually the trees began to thin
out and diminish in size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a new stand,&rdquo; Russ explained. &ldquo;Nowadays,
logging companies do as much replanting as
they do cutting. With proper methods of conservation,
they hope to undo some of the mistakes
of their predecessors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile farther on, they emerged
into a large clearing in which a half dozen low,
sprawling buildings were situated. There was a
great deal of activity in the camp. Across the clearing,
a convoy of trucks jammed with lumberjacks
pulled out of a dirt road and drew up in front of
one building where a long line was forming.
Whooping and laughing, the lumberjacks vaulted
the tail gates of the trucks and piled over the side-boards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Russ Steele smiled. &ldquo;Chow time. That&rsquo;s the
mess hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s their hurry?&rdquo; Quiz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you get mighty hungry swinging an
ax,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;I read once that a logger eats
about five thousand calories a day to keep him
going, as compared with the three thousand that
the average man needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry grunted. &ldquo;My old man says I must eat
close to ten thousand a day, every time he has to
pay the grocery bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand dollars&rsquo; worth a day?&rdquo; Sandy
said with a straight face. &ldquo;That sounds about right
for you, chow hound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry clipped the tall, slender boy on the arm
with his knuckles. &ldquo;Calories, you dope! Don&rsquo;t get
smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet neither one of you knows what a calorie
is?&rdquo; Quiz said dryly.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s forehead puckered up thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
think I do. It&rsquo;s a unit of energy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s close,&rdquo; Quiz admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the amount
of heat&mdash;heat is energy&mdash;required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water one degree
Centigrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry nudged Russ Steele. &ldquo;Bet you didn&rsquo;t know
that, General Steele?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Russ smiled good-naturedly. &ldquo;I had a vague
idea it was something like that. Let&rsquo;s find the office.
I used to know the foreman of this camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys eyed the lumberjacks admiringly as
they walked by the mess hall. Most of them were
stripped to the waist, their muscles bunching and
rippling in their sun-bronzed arms and torsos as
they moved about. The cuffs of their sweat-blackened
levis were tucked into the tops of hobnailed
boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s recruit a couple of these bruisers for the
Valley View football team. Our line would be a
stone wall for sure,&rdquo; Jerry whispered to Sandy.</p>
<p>Russ took them around the end of the mess hall
to a small frame shack in the middle of the camp.
A big collie was sitting in the open doorway. Instinctively,
Sandy reached down and got a hold on
Prince&rsquo;s collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; Russ told him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collie, recognizing Russ, came bounding
out of the shack and leaped up on his chest, trying
to lick his face. Russ pummeled him in the ribs
playfully. &ldquo;Bruce, old feller, how are you?&rdquo; He
looked up as a short, squat, bald-headed lumberjack
appeared in the doorway. &ldquo;Well, Jonas! I
figured they would have retired you by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The man&rsquo;s broad face lit up. &ldquo;Russ Steele! You
old dogface! What are you doing here this time of
year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought my nephew and a couple of his
buddies up on a camping trip. Boys, I&rsquo;d like you to
meet Jonas Driscoll, the toughest bull-of-the-woods
who ever swung an ax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the introductions, Jonas took them
through the back door of the mess hall while the
two dogs chased each other around the compound.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Cookie fix them up a grand feed from
the left-overs,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sandy felt self-conscious as Jonas cut in at the
head of the line and picked up metal compartment
trays and silverware for each of them. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
those other guys get sore?&rdquo; he asked, as they
walked away from the serving table.</p>
<p>Jonas laughed. &ldquo;Naw, you&rsquo;re company. Anyway,
they&rsquo;d be scared I&rsquo;d flatten &rsquo;em if they
kicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were about twenty wooden tables with
benches running down each side of the mess hall.
Jonas led them to a table at the rear that was
almost empty. Salt- and pepper-shakers and clean
cups were stacked in the middle of each table. As
they sat down, Jonas motioned to one of the mess
boys, a gangly youth about sixteen. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a
couple of pitchers of iced tea here, son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Jerry gazed bug-eyed at the five pork chops and
the mounds of mashed potatoes, vegetables and
apple sauce heaped up on his tray. &ldquo;This is
lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas Driscoll&rsquo;s blue eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Just a light
snack, son. Wait till you eat supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh boy!&rdquo; Jerry breathed rapturously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to sign him on one of your crews,
Jonas,&rdquo; Russ suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s light on muscle&mdash;except between the
ears,&rdquo; Sandy said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s got the appetite for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get sore with all this lovely food in
front of me,&rdquo; Jerry said, as he went to work with
knife and fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You been a lumberjack long, Mr. Driscoll?&rdquo;
Sandy inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty years last May. Started in as a cook&rsquo;s
helper when I was thirteen. And I expect to be at
it another forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ looked across at his old friend fondly.
&ldquo;Logging is still a rugged business, but nothing
like it used to be in Jonas&rsquo; prime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world,&rdquo; the foreman agreed. &ldquo;Electricity
and the gasoline engine have taken all the
work out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A kibitzing lumberjack at the end of the table
held up his hands, thick with calluses. &ldquo;Is that
<i>so</i>! Well, suppose you tell &rsquo;em where I got <i>these</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Jonas laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,
French. Them bulldozers and power saws don&rsquo;t
help you sawyers much&mdash;not in this camp anyway.&rdquo;
He turned to the boys. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the boys
who swing the axes and pull the big cross-cut
saws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all lumberjacks cut down trees?&rdquo; Quiz
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. There&rsquo;s a lot of different jobs in
logging just like in any other business. There&rsquo;s
sawyers, high riggers, yarders and river hogs.
After lunch, I&rsquo;ll take you out to the stand we&rsquo;re
cutting now and show you around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER SEVEN</span>
<br />A Birling Match</h2>
<p>In spite of the fact that Jonas Driscoll kept insisting
that all the glamour had gone out of
logging, Sandy and the boys found the business of
cutting timber fascinating. The husky lumberjacks
were amazingly thorough and efficient.
Jonas pointed out one massive pine, at least three
feet in diameter, that seemed to be the object of
heated discussion among the sawyer gang. Long
strings with leaded weights dangling at the ends
were fixed on the trunk at various heights to determine
the tree&rsquo;s angle to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them plumb lines help &rsquo;em figure out which
way that old feller would fall naturally,&rdquo; Jonas
explained. &ldquo;Then they got to take the wind into
account and the distribution of the foliage, plus a
few other things. After that the gang boss decides
how to make it fall where he wants it to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does it make where it falls?&rdquo;
Jerry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jonas drawled, &ldquo;a big feller like that
could squash a whole crew if it fell wrong, for one
thing. Or it could end up leaning against another
tree, which is kind of messy.&rdquo; He pointed out a
stand of seedlings to the left of the big tree. &ldquo;Or it
could break up a lot of those babies; that&rsquo;d be
cheating your grandchildren out of some fine
timber. A good crew boss can drop a tree smack
on a little wooden stake and hammer it into the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz looked impressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say your crew
bosses must have a thorough knowledge of mathematics
to be able to predict the angle of fall so
accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas scratched his bald head. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t
know, son. I suppose quite a few of the boys these
days have book learnin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Course, in my day, the
way you made crew boss was to lick the old boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody ever lick you, Mr. Driscoll?&rdquo;
Sandy asked.</p>
<p>The old man drew back his lips, displaying two
rows of broken teeth. &ldquo;A couple of times, as you
can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked closer to the big pine tree as two
muscular sawyers started to make the undercut
that would determine the direction the tree would
fall. The chips flew as their double-edged axes
flashed in the sunlight, and a wedge widened
rapidly in the side of the trunk. Their strokes
were rhythmic and effortless. Jonas called their
attention to the smoothness of the undercut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The scarf is as clean as
if it was cut by a saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the undercut was completed to the crew
chief&rsquo;s satisfaction, two other men went to work
with a wicked-looking two-handled saw with a
curved blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We better mosey back to the sidelines,&rdquo; Jonas
told them. &ldquo;Mistakes do happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a safe distance they watched until, at last,
the tree began to tremble throughout its length
like a live thing. Before the saw was completely
through the trunk, there was a grinding, crackling
noise and the crown swayed and dipped. Suddenly
there was a sharp report that Sandy first mistook
for an explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s falling!&rdquo; Jonas said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tim-m-ber!</i>&rdquo; the crew boss sang out at the
top of his lungs as the great tree toppled slowly
and majestically. It landed with a thunderous
crash that blurred Sandy&rsquo;s vision and jarred his
teeth. And then, for a full minute, it lay there,
writhing and groaning like some prehistoric
monster in the throes of death.</p>
<p>The boys were awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything like it,&rdquo; Jerry whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sort of gives you a lump in your throat,&rdquo;
Quiz said, his voice touched with reverence.
&ldquo;That tree was probably hundreds of years old.
Now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas dropped one hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Not really. That old tree will help build a lot of
fine houses and furnish &rsquo;em too. Studding, shingles,
chairs, tables, cabinets, the works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately, another crew with light power
saws began cleaning the limbs off the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon as she&rsquo;s limbed,&rdquo; Jonas explained,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll cut up the trunk into manageable lengths
and the dozers and cranes will stack &rsquo;em in cold
decks.&rdquo; He indicated a neat pile of logs at one
side of the road. &ldquo;In the old days we had to let
them sit here until winter when the roads were
iced over, so they&rsquo;d slide easy behind the horses.
Today, we use trailer trucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes it a lot easier on everybody, doesn&rsquo;t it,
Jonas,&rdquo; Russ Steele said. &ldquo;Now, tell the truth, the
&lsquo;good old days&rsquo; weren&rsquo;t really so good, were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man grinned sheepishly. &ldquo;Well&mdash;we
got the job done just the same,&rdquo; he said lamely.</p>
<p>Tractors, with thresher-like attachments, moved
back and forth along the length of the felled tree,
gathering up the lopped-off branches and chewing
them up into smaller pieces. These scraps were
later heaped up into mounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come winter, we&rsquo;ll burn a lot of that slash and
spread the ashes around for fertilizer,&rdquo; Jonas explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be quite a fire hazard in this weather,&rdquo;
Russ Steele said.</p>
<p>The foreman&rsquo;s mouth tightened. &ldquo;This heat
spell has everybody on edge. It&rsquo;s getting so I wake
up every half hour at night, thinking I smell
smoke. We been posting fire watches out here on
our own. Them poor rangers got their hands full
as it is. You really picked a bad time to go camping,
Russ. You going back to Red Lake from
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ smiled evasively. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. We
thought we might go up to the border and watch
your boys run some of these logs down the big
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas shook his head. &ldquo;Water level&rsquo;s too low.
You boys want to see a gen-u-wine logging drive,
come back up here next spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was disappointed. &ldquo;I sure hoped to see
that. Do lumberjacks really ride on top of the logs
the way you see it in the movies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say they do, son.
Why a good river hog can ride a fresh pine log
through the mill tail as pretty as a Hawaiian on
a surfboard. Say, maybe we can put on a bit of a
show for you at that. C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led them down the slope toward a small
pond nestling in the valley. On the way, he called
to two loggers stacking logs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pete! Charley! Want to show off your birling
for our visitors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wearing big grins, the two husky men fell in
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete and Charley are the camp champs,&rdquo; Jonas
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s birling?&rdquo; Quiz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A game the old-timers dreamed up to pass the
time on long drives. Two men set themselves on
opposite ends of a log and then they try to shake
each other off into the drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy!&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;That sounds like fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fun,&rdquo; Jonas agreed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also become
quite a skillful sport. Wait till you see these boys
go at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the pond, Pete and Charley
carefully chose a log about two feet in diameter
and twelve feet long from a pile nearby and rolled
it into the water. Then they stepped onto opposite
ends of the log and Jonas shoved it into the middle
of the pond with a long pole. The two big men,
hobnailed boots planted firmly in the bark, rode
the bobbing log like cats, their thumbs hooked
nonchalantly in their belts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks easy,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kid yourself,&rdquo; said Quiz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>At a signal from Jonas, the contest began. Pete
took the offensive at once. Back-pedaling with
short, mincing steps, he sent the log rolling over
and over in the water. Faster and faster his feet
moved until the log was a spinning blur beneath
them. But Charley jogged effortlessly with the
spin, never once removing his thumbs from under
his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be part fly,&rdquo; Sandy murmured admiringly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Pete braked the log with his spikes.
Charley hung on nimbly, though he did have to
extend his arms for balance. Pete studied his opponent
briefly, then tried another approach.
Facing the other man, he spread his feet, spikes
dug deep into the soft bark. Throwing his weight
to the right, he rolled the log to that side, then
jerked it back sharply in the opposite direction.
Back and forth, back and forth, he went, stirring
up waves in the little pond. Charley just crouched
low and rolled with the log.</p>
<p>Finally, Pete abandoned this method too, and
began to jump up and down on his end of the log
until it was lurching up and down in the water
like a seesaw. Once Charley&rsquo;s boot slipped as the
log rolled unexpectedly, but he recovered himself
neatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such a display of balance and
coordination,&rdquo; Russ said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hundred tricks,&rdquo; Jonas told him.
&ldquo;Every birler has his own pet twists and turns and
stops. Why I&rsquo;ve seen my old man spend hours
studying a log before a big match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;They all look pretty
much the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Logs are as different as fingerprints. Pine logs
are lighter than spruce, for example, and roll
much faster. Cedar logs ride higher in the water.
Thin bark is a different proposition than thick
spongy bark&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off as the two birlers
both sent the log spinning madly in the water.
&ldquo;Here now, watch old Charley go to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faster and faster the log spun; then with a display
of skill that set Jonas to clapping his hands,
Charley braked the spin and sent the log twirling
in the opposite direction before poor Pete could
shift his feet. He flipped over backward into the
pond with a loud splash.</p>
<p>The boys joined in the round of applause for
Charley, as Pete surfaced and good-naturedly
shoved the log in to shore, so the winner wouldn&rsquo;t
get his feet wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of practice,&rdquo; Pete puffed, as he waded
in, dripping wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No excuses,&rdquo; Jonas laughed. &ldquo;Anyway, that
saves you taking a bath tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Jerry. &ldquo;Still think it&rsquo;s easy, young
fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well-l-l,&rdquo; Jerry drawled, &ldquo;I think with a little
practice I could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;No time like the present,&rdquo; Jonas declared.
&ldquo;How about it, Sandy? You game to take your
pal on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;Sure thing. I don&rsquo;t care if I do
fall in. It&rsquo;s so darned hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas brought the log in closer to the bank and
braced it with his pole. &ldquo;Okay, boys, climb
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy bowed with a flourish to the dark-haired
boy. &ldquo;After you, my dear Alphonse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping out on the log as cautiously as a tightrope
walker on the high wire, Jerry planted his
feet firmly, crouching very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit down and straddle it,&rdquo;
Quiz heckled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No remarks from the gallery,&rdquo; Jerry grunted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting the feel of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy took his place a trifle more confidently,
and Jonas shoved the log into the middle of the
pond. Jerry tottered and flailed his arms wildly in
the air as the log started to roll beneath him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, cut that out! We didn&rsquo;t get the signal to
start yet,&rdquo; he protested to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing a thing.&rdquo; Sandy was concentrating
on keeping his feet moving rhythmically
with the motion of the log. In spite of his efforts
to slow it down, it kept picking up momentum,
largely because of Jerry&rsquo;s frenzied footwork.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>On shore, Quiz, Russ Steele and the loggers
were doubled up with laughter. Jonas gasped, &ldquo;He
looks like a clown I saw at a circus running on a
treadmill with a dog hanging onto the seat of his
pants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was too much for Sandy. Choking
hysterically, he went headfirst into the pond. But
still Jerry&rsquo;s mad marathon went on. &ldquo;How do you
stop this thing?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just turn off your ignition,&rdquo; Charley joked.</p>
<p>The tears were rolling down Pete&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t seen a birler like that boy in all my days.
He&rsquo;d be a sensation at the fall festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; Jerry screamed desperately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to bail out before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo; Holding his
nose he ran off the end of the log into thin air. His
legs were still driving like pistons as the water
closed over him.</p>
<p>When the boys waded ashore, Jerry grinned
sheepishly at the loggers. &ldquo;I was doing great till
my accelerator got stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonas patted him on the back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,
Jerry. Best show I&rsquo;ve seen all year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking up the hill, Jonas asked Russ, &ldquo;How
long will you be with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess we&rsquo;ll be heading back to Red Lake
tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better follow the river south as far as you can,&rdquo;
Jonas cautioned him. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to get
caught in the deep woods if a fire gets started.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>By this time the sun had sunk below the trees,
and the loggers were boarding the trucks for the
ride back to camp. Russ and Quiz rode back with
Jonas in the cab of the lead truck, while Sandy
and Jerry piled in the one behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fellows live in the woods all year?&rdquo;
Sandy asked the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us single men do,&rdquo; the driver told him.
&ldquo;It saves board money living in the company
barracks and eating three squares in the mess hall.
A few of the married boys live in town. We got a
couple of little towns within a comfortable distance.
Some weekends we go in and stay at a rooming
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever get to the big city?&rdquo; Jerry asked
wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe once a year, we go to Duluth.&rdquo; He
began to laugh uproariously. &ldquo;It usually takes us
another year to get over a spree like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back at camp, Russ Steele spoke earnestly with
Jonas Driscoll off to one side. Then he went into
the office alone and closed the door behind him.
The foreman walked over to where the boys were
throwing sticks for the two dogs to fetch and told
Sandy that his uncle was making an important
phone call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a while,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
boys come down to my shack and wash up before
supper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Sandy looked meaningfully at Jerry and Quiz.
&ldquo;You guys go ahead with Jonas. I&rsquo;ll be along in a
few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of sight, Sandy went
over and sat down on the steps of the office. Prince
and Bruce camped at his feet, wagging their tails
and pleading with their eyes for more play. Finally
Sandy gave in and lobbed a few more sticks for
them. After about ten minutes, Russ Steele came
out of the office. He was so preoccupied with his
thoughts that he almost stumbled over his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy nodded sympathetically. &ldquo;Still no news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trace. It begins to look more and more
as if they ditched the bomb over this area. Search
teams are working in toward us methodically from
both Lake Superior and Manitoba where the
plane crashed. We&rsquo;ll just have to do what we can
until reinforcements arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the west heat lightning lit up the sky like a
monster flash bulb. Sandy shivered as they walked
slowly in the direction of the foreman&rsquo;s cottage.
The air seemed to be buzzing with electricity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER EIGHT</span>
<br />Fire!</h2>
<p>After breakfast the next morning, Russ Steele
and the boys said goodbye to Jonas Driscoll and
started back in the direction of Red Lake. Once
again they fanned out at 1500-foot intervals, as
soon as they were out of sight of the logging camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like such a waste of time,&rdquo; Jerry complained.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re never going to find that bomb,
just four guys in a big woods like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Russ admitted. &ldquo;Our
team is only a small cog in the vast search machinery,
but the ultimate success of the operation
depends on how well each small team does its job.
The military doesn&rsquo;t expect us to march straight
to where the bomb is and say, &lsquo;Here it is, fellows!&rsquo;
What they do expect is for us to be able to say
with certainty where the bomb is <i>not</i> lying.
Gradually, by a process of elimination, they&rsquo;ll be
able to pinpoint its exact location.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The trek south was just as unrewarding as the
trek north. They covered twenty-five miles by
dusk, when they made camp and cooked a simple
supper of beans and bacon. The boys were so
weary that they sacked in before it was completely
dark. Russ Steele sat outside awhile smoking his
pipe and watching the moon climb into the cloudless
heavens.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon of the following day,
they arrived back at the ranger station. Dick
Fellows signaled them with a flashing mirror from
the tower when they were still a half mile away.
By the time they arrived, he had a pitcher of iced
tea frosting on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; he said flatly, as soon as he saw their
faces.</p>
<p>Russ shook his head. &ldquo;How about yourself? Still
no rain in sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranger sighed. &ldquo;Just got the forecast before
you got here. Fair and hot for the rest of the week.
I&rsquo;ve been on twenty-four-hour duty for the past
two days. Headquarters has declared a state of
emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you grab a couple of hours&rsquo; sleep?&rdquo;
Sandy suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep a careful watch
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;maybe I will. I&rsquo;ve been
sleeping with one eye open these nights, and one
ear on the alarm clock. How long are you fellows
going to stay around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Russ told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cover the ground between here and Red
Lake next trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was 2:30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> Dick Fellows had been asleep
for about an hour. Quiz and Jerry had left to take
a bath in a nearby stream. Russ Steele was relaxing
in the big easy chair with his pipe and a book
from the ranger&rsquo;s library. Sandy was on watch.
Standing at the north window, he swept the horizon
from east to west with a pair of binoculars.
Three-quarters of the way across, he stopped and
trained them down on a tall trunk that stood out
bleak and spare against the thick foliage of the
other trees. With a frown, he dropped the glasses
and blinked his eyes, squinting through the distant
haze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Russ,&rdquo; he said steadily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably
an illusion, but I think I see smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele rose quickly, dumping the book off
his lap onto the floor. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked tensely,
coming to the window.</p>
<p>Sandy passed the binoculars to him. &ldquo;That big
snag due north-northwest.&rdquo; While his uncle was
studying the location, Sandy went back to the
table and picked up a pair of sunglasses specially
treated to penetrate haze. &ldquo;Well, what do you
think?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Russ said tightly. &ldquo;It could be
heat waves shimmering through the ground haze.&rdquo;
He turned to look at the sleeping figure of the
ranger on the bunk. &ldquo;In any case, I think it rates
the attention of an expert. Better wake Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Fellows sat up promptly the instant Sandy&rsquo;s
hand touched his shoulder. &ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; he asked
grimly. He was at the window focusing the binoculars
before Sandy had finished explaining.
After a brief look, he put down the binoculars
and studied the trouble spot through the haze
glasses.</p>
<p>Then he announced matter-of-factly: &ldquo;Smoke,
all right. Well, we&rsquo;ve got ourselves a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice sounded almost relieved. The waiting
and the anxiety were over now, at least. The
enemy was out in the open&mdash;something tangible
you could see and fight.</p>
<p>Immediately, the ranger made a compass reading.
Then he took a fix on the smoking tree with
an Osborne fire finder, an instrument roughly resembling
a sextant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire finder measures both horizontal and
vertical angles,&rdquo; he explained to Sandy. &ldquo;If we
know the height of the fire tower and the angle
of the fire with respect to the top of the tower,
it&rsquo;s a relatively easy matter to locate the site on a
good topographical map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a topographical map?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;A map that charts the surface features of the
terrain,&rdquo; Dick said. He went back to the table
and made some rapid calculations on a pad,
stopping occasionally to measure off distances and
angles on the big map spread out before him. At
last he stuck a red pin at an X that marked the
intersection of two lines. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where she is,&rdquo;
he said with finality. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll radio the news in
to headquarters. They&rsquo;ll try and get a sighting
from another tower and double-check my fix on
the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do in the meantime?&rdquo; Russ Steele
asked anxiously. Sandy could see that, underneath
the heavy tan, his uncle was pale. He had a flitting
mental image of the missing A-bomb lying in some
desolate part of the forest with flames licking in
all around it, and he felt the short hairs at the base
of his skull bristle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go straight to the fire and see what I can
do until a crew shows up,&rdquo; the ranger said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got yourself a crew,&rdquo; Russ volunteered.
&ldquo;What can we do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Fellows smiled gratefully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful.
I&rsquo;ve got plenty of tools stored out in the shed.
With any luck, maybe we can get it under control
before it spreads too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, they heard Prince barking at
the foot of the tower and footsteps vibrating on
the metal steps. &ldquo;That must be Quiz and Jerry,&rdquo;
Sandy said. He ran to the door, opened it and
called down. &ldquo;Stay where you are. We&rsquo;ll be right
down. We&rsquo;re going to fight a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Within fifteen minutes, the five of them were
double-timing it through the woods, loaded down
with long-handled shovels, burlap sacks, fire
swatters and strange-looking implements that the
boys had never seen before. One resembled a giant
fly swatter; another, the Pulaski tool, was a combination
ax and grub hoe. They had covered,
perhaps, ten miles, when Prince, who had gone
running far ahead, began to yelp excitedly. Before
they even sighted the flames, they could hear the
crackle and roar of a formidable blaze.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows ran his tongue nervously over dry
lips. &ldquo;Not much smoke. She had a good start before
we spotted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the ranger&rsquo;s words, Sandy felt a wave
of relief when they finally reached the fire. It
didn&rsquo;t look nearly as bad as he had expected it to
be. At most, it ranged over a quarter of an acre,
blazing lazily in the surface litter that covered
the forest floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s just a little brush fire.&rdquo; Jerry echoed
his friend&rsquo;s sentiments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;So far,&rdquo; the ranger said grimly. &ldquo;But all it will
take is a little breeze&mdash;&rdquo; He left the thought unfinished,
as without warning a dead tree that stood
in the center of the fire, blackened and smoldering,
burst into flame like a torch. The rotten wood
gave off great flaming sparks that were carried
high into the air by the updraft. Sandy traced the
journey of one glowing ember as it plummeted
down like a shooting star into the woods about a
half mile away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could mean more trouble,&rdquo; the ranger
said. &ldquo;Before you know it, you have a half dozen
spot fires burning in addition to the one you&rsquo;re
fighting. I&rsquo;ll have a look over in that direction
later on. The first thing we&rsquo;re going to do is to
build a fire line across the head of the fire; I&rsquo;d say
maybe fifteen feet in front of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz nodded. &ldquo;The head of the fire is determined
by the direction in which it&rsquo;s spreading
the fastest. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. All fires have a roughly circular shape
to begin with. But depending on air currents,
slope of the terrain and available fuel, they soon
take on direction. Usually they assume an elliptical
shape, sort of like an egg, with the fat part of
the egg representing the head. We always attack
the head first&mdash;stop the advance. Then we can
work down the flanks to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fire line will be about one hundred feet
long. I&rsquo;d say this particular fire calls for a trench
about two feet wide through the duff and litter;
we&rsquo;ve got to get down to mineral soil. Everything
inflammable must be cleared off this path. Bushes
or low-hanging branches that the flames can reach
have to be removed or avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>At this point, he stopped talking to lay out the
fire line, tracing its path through the forest with
a hoe. It was a zigzag route which detoured around
bushes that were too large to be uprooted and low-hanging
tree branches. &ldquo;We avoid anything that
would give the flames a chance to leap the fire
line,&rdquo; Dick explained.</p>
<p>As soon as the boundaries were clearly defined,
he distributed the tools and assigned specific jobs
to everyone. Russell Steele showed as much respect
for the young ranger as any enlisted man had
ever accorded a general. Sandy and Jerry worked
with the hoes, breaking the first ground. Their
job consisted mainly in clearing a swath through
the loose litter, shoving it in toward the advancing
flames.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows and Russ Steele came in back of
them with Pulaski tools, hacking out stubborn
roots and small shrubs and cutting deeper into the
duff. Quiz brought up the rear with a shovel,
scooping up loose matter that had tumbled back
into the ditch and sluicing a light layer of soil
across the ground in front of the line. They
worked intently, without speaking, to conserve
their wind; and the line grew rapidly. Still, the
fire was within two feet of the barrier when
Quiz sent the last shovel of dirt rattling into the
waist-high flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The heat was searing, and their lobster-red
faces streamed with perspiration. Their clothing
was soaked and streaked with dirt. Jerry and Quiz
staggered back from the line and collapsed on the
ground.</p>
<p>The ranger waved Sandy and his uncle back
too. &ldquo;Better take a breather,&rdquo; he warned them.
&ldquo;The worst is yet to come.&rdquo; He took a long drink,
then emptied the rest of his canteen over his head.</p>
<p>After a five-minute break, Dick passed out the
long-handled beaters to the three boys. He handed
Russ Steele a burlap bag soaked in water. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
do the best we can with these. The idea is to patrol
the line and keep a sharp watch for embers that
fly over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stationed themselves at 25-foot intervals,
with Russ and Dick each holding down an end of
the line. The flames reached the edge of the break
and leaned hungrily across it.</p>
<p>Sandy brought the flat of his rubber beater
down on a spark that kindled on his side of the
line. &ldquo;It gives me the creeps the way the fire seems
to be reaching out for you,&rdquo; he yelled to Jerry.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as if it was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was too busy swatting to answer him.
Down at one end of the line, Dick tossed aside his
smoking burlap sack and grabbed a shovel. With
horror, Sandy saw a thin trail of fire race along the
edge of the ditch, skirt the end and blaze up in a
patch of grass around the ranger&rsquo;s legs. Sandy
dashed down to attack the breach with Dick, and
together they extinguished the flames and the long
fuse of burning grass that had kindled it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dick gasped, as Sandy raced back to
beat at a fiery tongue that was licking at the brush
in his sector.</p>
<p>For at least a half hour they battled the tenacious
foe, and then the flames began to subside,
their frantic efforts to leap the line growing more
and more feeble.</p>
<p>At last Dick Fellows announced hesitantly,
&ldquo;Looks like we have her, men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys let out a lusty cheer, and Jerry did a
comical little waltz with his long beater. But their
exultation was short-lived. For some time, no one
had paid much attention to the dead tree in the
center of the burned-out area, now a solid pillar
of fire reaching into the sky. The ranger had been
relieved to note that it stood a safe distance apart
from the other trees, and he decided that its chief
hazard lay in the sparks that kept rising intermittently
from it. Then disaster struck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Crumbling from decay and the ravages of
termites, and further weakened by the flames, the
towering snag unexpectedly gave way at the base.
As the fire fighters stared in hypnotic fascination,
the tree toppled in slow motion toward a thick
cluster of pines on the left flank of the fire. It went
crashing down into their midst, sending a spray of
sparks and flame over the thick, dry foliage. Instantly
the crowns of the trees erupted simultaneously
in a huge balloon of flame with a noise like
an exploding bomb. A blast of red-hot air singed
Sandy&rsquo;s hair and eyelashes and sent him stumbling
backward with his hands over his face. Rejuvenated,
the front of the fire leaped the barrier and
blazed up beyond control at a dozen separate
points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s crowned!&rdquo; the ranger yelled in despair.
&ldquo;That snag did it. The surface fire had heated the
foliage to the point of combustion and it was just
like touching a match to a gas jet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was aware of a strange rustling in the
trees overhead. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked the
ranger. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wind all right,&rdquo; Dick told him. &ldquo;Once these
fires get really going, they make their own wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple,&rdquo; Quiz explained. &ldquo;You can even
feel it standing near a big bonfire. The updraft of
hot air creates a partial vacuum over the fire area,
sucking in cool air from all around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Russ demanded.</p>
<p>The ranger pointed to the crown fire, which
was spreading from tree to tree fairly rapidly.
&ldquo;Only thing to do is get out of here. We don&rsquo;t
want to get caught if this thing really takes off.
There&rsquo;s a firebreak about one mile back, where
we can wait for reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>He glanced up at the sky, and for the first time
Sandy was aware that a helicopter and a small observation
plane were circling the area. &ldquo;They
should be rallying a gang up there within a few
hours,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a firebreak, Dick?&rdquo; Quiz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A king-sized fire line similar to the one we
made. It can be anywhere from ten feet to a
hundred feet wide. Nowadays critical areas are interlaced
with firebreaks, just in case. The one
we&rsquo;re heading for is a road really; the idea is to
take advantage of natural defenses as much as
possible when planning firebreaks&mdash;roads, rivers,
clearings, railroad right of ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they followed the ranger at a slow trot in the
direction of the road, Prince leaped out from
behind a bush and fell in beside Russ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to wonder what had happened
to him,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animals are deathly afraid of fire,&rdquo; Russ said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised he isn&rsquo;t on his way back to Red
Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry snorted. &ldquo;Some hero! And I thought dogs
were supposed to be fearless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ looked at Jerry solemnly. &ldquo;Only fools are
fearless. I can tell you I&rsquo;m plenty scared right now&mdash;for
more reasons than one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER NINE</span>
<br />Battling the Flames</h2>
<p>By the time they reached the firebreak, men and
trucks were streaming down the dirt road from
both directions; rangers and volunteers from the
logging camps and small towns in the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we sit back here like soldiers in trenches
and wait for the fire to come to us?&rdquo; Sandy wanted
to know.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not likely.
That&rsquo;s too much timber to give up without a fight.
Most likely the fire boss will try and contain the
fire within some area much closer to the front.
We&rsquo;ll construct another fire line&mdash;a lot bigger
than the one we made, of course&mdash;and backfire
from that, probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Backfire?&rdquo; Jerry looked puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, light more fires all along that line.&rdquo; He
had to smile at the boy&rsquo;s incredulous stare. &ldquo;Fires
that we know we can control. It&rsquo;s the only way to
stop a running crown fire. A running fire picks up
a lot of momentum&mdash;you saw how those flames
jumped our line. The idea is to light the backfires
right on the edge of your fire line so that they&rsquo;ll
burn in the opposite direction, toward the main
fire. Actually, the air currents created by a big
blaze tend to draw in the smaller backfires. Under
ideal conditions, the two fires meet head-on and
die because all the fuel has been exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fascinating image,&rdquo; Russ said. &ldquo;Like
two greedy monsters destroying each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know where they got that old saying
about fighting fire with fire,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the ranger acknowledged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
an old trick that goes back earlier than the
Christian era. Tricky business, though, and you
have to have a gang that knows what it&rsquo;s doing
every second. If anything goes wrong, the backfire
may get out of control and leap the fire line
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up as a tall gray-haired man in riding
breeches and high boots got out of a truck on the
far side of the road and hailed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Fellows! How does it look?&rdquo; the tall man
came across and joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Paul! Not too good. We thought we had
her for a time. Then everything burst loose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>He introduced Paul Landers, the district ranger
chief, to Russ Steele and the boys, describing their
unsuccessful effort to stop the fire before it
crowned.</p>
<p>Landers shook his head grimly. &ldquo;Nice try, anyway,
Dick. And many thanks to you, General
Steele, and the boys, for lending a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ smiled. &ldquo;Anything else we can do? We&rsquo;re
still available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire boss took off his ranger hat and
mopped his brow with a handkerchief. &ldquo;Plenty to
do, all right, General. Soon as they get my headquarters
tent set up over there, we&rsquo;ll be having
a meeting of crew chiefs. I&rsquo;d welcome it if you&rsquo;d sit
in. You ever had any experience fighting fires?
Before today, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a greenhorn,&rdquo; Russ admitted. &ldquo;Just like
the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re learning fast,&rdquo; Jerry chimed in.</p>
<p>Landers laughed. &ldquo;Good. That tent&rsquo;s up now.
Come along and I&rsquo;ll show you how we map out our
battle strategy.&rdquo; He glanced at Russ. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going
to find, General, that a forest fire can be as
diabolical and treacherous as any human enemy
you ever fought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect that already,&rdquo; Russ
said somberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Inside the big pyramidal tent, technicians were
installing short-wave radio equipment, electric
lights and telephones. On a large square table in
the center of the tent, a topographical map was
spread out; alongside it was a vivid aerial photograph
of the same region.</p>
<p>Landers indicated a section on the map shaded
in red pencil. &ldquo;This represents the burned-out
area, as it stands at this time. Roughly, the front
is about twelve hundred feet across, and she&rsquo;s
spreading fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Fellows whistled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say she&rsquo;s spreading
fast. I don&rsquo;t figure it was more than a hundred
feet when we pulled out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire boss bent over the map and rested
both elbows on the table. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got all the
makings of a Class E fire all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Class E fire?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forest fires are rated in five classes, A,B,C,D,
and E, according to the size of the burned-out
area,&rdquo; Landers explained. &ldquo;Class E is three
hundred acres and up. This one could be a first-rate
Class E if it gets away from us. So we can&rsquo;t
afford to take chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied the map thoughtfully. &ldquo;The way I
see it we&rsquo;ve got to give her plenty of room. If we
can hold her down to two hundred acres, I&rsquo;ll be
plenty satisfied.&rdquo; He ran his finger along a ridge
that ran off diagonally to the road in a northeast
direction on the right flank of the fire. Then he
penciled an <i>X</i> at the foot of the ridge directly in
line with the head of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our best chance is to start backfiring here,
about a half mile due east. That ridge is a natural
firebreak because it&rsquo;s mostly rock with only
scrubby vegetation. It won&rsquo;t take more than a
skeleton crew to work that side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He addressed two of the gang bosses: &ldquo;Harry
and Ed, you boys take ten men and a bulldozer
and start setting things up on that ridge. A three-thousand-foot
line should do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now from the foot of the ridge, he drew a line
extending in a southeast direction, so that between
them they formed an angled pocket into which
the fire was advancing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll backfire for another
three thousand feet on this line. The rest of you
gang bosses will round up your men and get to
work on that immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He singled out Dick Fellows. &ldquo;Dick, you and
your three young friends can help out on the
south line, if you will, as fire scouts. General
Steele, I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you would help me get
things organized here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys followed Ranger Fellows out of the
tent as the gang bosses crowded around the table
for a question-and-answer session with the fire boss
and to get a final briefing. Sandy was surprised to
see that dusk was settling over the forest. He
looked at his wrist watch and saw that almost five
hours had passed since he had spotted the first
thin swirl of smoke from the fire tower. To the
west an enormous golden cloud hung over the
trees like a halo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that look beautiful?&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deadly beauty,&rdquo; the ranger told him, explaining
that it was the last rays of sunlight slanting up
from below the horizon on the screen of smoke
drifting up from the forest fire.</p>
<p>He led them over to the mess tent, where cooks
were doling out steaming-hot suppers to the fire
fighters from big insulated containers. &ldquo;Eat hearty,
men,&rdquo; he said wryly as they took their places on
line. &ldquo;We have a long night ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can anyone work in these woods at
night?&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;It gets so dark you can&rsquo;t see
your hand in front of your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy,&rdquo; the ranger admitted. &ldquo;Normally,
Landers would wait until daylight to tackle most
fires. The rate of spread drops sharply through
the night, then picks up again when the sun rises.
Dawn and early morning are generally the best
hours to work. But conditions being what they are&mdash;this
drought and all&mdash;the chief wants us to keep
on top of it every minute. It won&rsquo;t be any picnic,
though, building that south fire line at night, even
if they mount auxiliary spotlights on the trucks
and tractors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gives with this fire scout business?&rdquo; Jerry
wanted to know. &ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Run messages up and down the line so that
headquarters can keep in touch with the progress
on all sectors at all times,&rdquo; Dick explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be stationed at the junction of the north and south
lines with a walkie-talkie radio. You fellows will
relay reports from the gang bosses in to me, and
I&rsquo;ll call them in to the chief.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
going to be mighty leg-weary before this is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the head of the serving table, a grizzled old
man wearing a greasy undershirt handed them
each a tin plate and a knife and spoon. In quick
succession, Sandy received a ladle of hash, a ladle
of cole slaw and a slab of bread&mdash;at least two
inches thick&mdash;slapped on top of it all. The last
man on the serving line dipped a tin mug expertly
into a galvanized can filled with iced tea
and sent him on his way. Sandy had intended to
ask for something to eat for Prince, but then he
saw that the big Doberman was squatting patiently
before the entrance of the headquarters tent, waiting
for Russ Steele.</p>
<p>When they had finished eating, they scraped
their platters clean and dropped them in a tub of
soapy, boiling water to one side of the mess tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>It was almost dark now, but the area was bright
in the glare of spotlights that had been rigged
up to the heavy power line strung from poles at
the side of the road. Dick Fellows stopped briefly
at headquarters to pick up his walkie-talkie radio,
and then they hitched a ride on a jeep truck. They
were part of a long caravan of vehicles moving
slowly through the woods toward the foot of the
ridge where the fire line would be anchored. The
boys could scarcely believe that a road had been
cut through the timber in such a short period of
time. True, it was rutted, and bristled with
stumps, and twisted considerably to avoid the
biggest trees, but it was quite an accomplishment
nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic,&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;How did they
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bulldozer magic,&rdquo; the ranger said, pointing
to the broken and uprooted trees littering the
sides of the road. &ldquo;We even have some brush-breaker
trucks that can plow through a grove of
trees up to six inches in diameter as if they were
matchsticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caravan ground to a halt before they
reached the foot of the ridge, so the dozers and
tractors could complete a huge clearing where the
vehicles and equipment could assemble. To Sandy,
it was a scene of immense confusion and noise. It
seemed to him that the gang bosses were trying to
outshout each other; the men were getting in
each other&rsquo;s way; and the trucks and tractors were
rumbling about aimlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess!&rdquo; Jerry groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The ranger grinned. &ldquo;It just looks that way.
This is as smooth an operation as I&rsquo;ve ever seen.
Wait till they get rolling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in no time at all men and machines were
peeling off in orderly fashion to the right and left;
up the ridge to the northeast; and southwest
through the forest, clearing a strip through the
trees the width of two bulldozers.</p>
<p>Behind the dozers came the plows, rooting up
the thick bed of duff on the forest floor; then the
graders, piling up soil and sand in a high bank
against the advancing flames. Working by the light
of big spots mounted on trucks, agile volunteers&mdash;mainly
high riggers from the lumber camps&mdash;climbed
the trees along the edge of the growing
line, lopping off low branches that hung across
into the danger area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to make sure our backfires don&rsquo;t backfire
on us,&rdquo; Dick Fellows said wryly.</p>
<p>The young ranger set up his command post in
the headlights of a jeep; it consisted of a folding
table, canvas chair and the walkie-talkie. Quiz was
intrigued by the little battery-operated receiver-transmitter.
Dick pulled the rod antennae out of
the top of the little oblong case until they were
fully extended, and flipped the switch. There was
a crackle of static and a variety of other interference
before he succeeded in getting through to
Fire Boss Landers at headquarters. Reception was
poor and he kept his head bent close to the instrument.
The boys were only able to catch
snatches of the conversation. Finally he signed off
and looked up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;The chief just received a report from air
observation. She&rsquo;s progressing pretty much according
to type. About three-quarters of a mile wide
at the head, and covering roughly one hundred
acres. There&rsquo;s just enough wind to benefit us&mdash;keep
the fire moving due east and restricting the
spread at the rear. Unless the picture alters radically
before morning, we&rsquo;ve got her licked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>Quiz glanced over the treetops at the faint
reddish glow in the sky to the west. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nearly
so bright over that way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the ranger agreed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because
the crown fire has died out. It&rsquo;s strictly a
surface fire now. Of course if we get another
scorcher tomorrow, she&rsquo;ll likely flare up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was peering anxiously through the thick
forest in front of them. &ldquo;You can just about see
the flames now flickering over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Dick admitted. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only about
a quarter of a mile off now.&rdquo; Ruefully, he surveyed
the tall, stately pines in the grove opposite
them. &ldquo;It breaks my heart to think we&rsquo;re going
to have to sacrifice all that timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we go to work?&rdquo; Sandy asked him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right now. The chief wants to know how
things are progressing all the way down the line
and he wants a thorough report on the contour of
the fire front. Sandy, suppose you work the ridge,
and Jerry and Quiz can take the south line. Find
the gang bosses and ask them how things are
shaping up in their sectors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy climbed a steep rocky incline at the right
of the clearing to the top of the ridge. From the
crest, which was nearly forty feet higher than any
of the surrounding terrain, he had an unrestricted
view along the full length of the ridge. A full
moon sitting on the very rim of the horizon lit up
the scene like a big orange bulb. It was obvious
now why Fire Boss Landers had chosen this site
to construct the fire line. It was a natural barrier
running straight as an arrow to the northwest, at
least a mile long from tip to tip. Its rocky slopes,
barren except for grass and stunted shrubs, swept
down about a hundred feet on each side to the
edge of the woods. The ridge was a great scar in
the rich Minnesota earth left by some passing
glacier millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Halfway along the ridge, Sandy could see the
dozers rumbling back and forth over the crest,
their headlights gleaming like the eyes of prehistoric
monsters. He started toward them at a
dogtrot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>When he reached the nearest gang, a big man
who seemed to be directing the operation swung
his flashlight full on Sandy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Hi, son, what&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy explained that he was scouting for
Ranger Fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ed Macauley,&rdquo; the gang boss introduced
himself. &ldquo;Everything looks pretty good from here.
We&rsquo;re clearing a strip about ten feet wide just
below the crest on the far side here. We&rsquo;ll start
our backfires down there in that tall grass at the
edge of the woods. Then for good measure we&rsquo;ll
light another one along the top of the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was puzzled. &ldquo;One thing I don&rsquo;t understand.
Why are you making the fire line on the
slope away from the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macauley grinned. &ldquo;Because fire burns a lot
faster and picks up more momentum going uphill
than it does going downhill.&rdquo; To illustrate, he
took a long wooden match out of his pocket and
lit it with his thumbnail. When he tilted the lit
end down, the flame blazed up brightly, licking
greedily at the unburned stem. Then he tilted
the end up and the flame changed direction and
flickered feebly at the blackened stub and finally
died out. &ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s less chance of the fire jumping
our line if it&rsquo;s burning downhill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Suddenly he frowned and poked his nose into
the air like a scenting hound. &ldquo;Hey, you feel
that?&rdquo; He wet his forefinger in his mouth and
held it up.</p>
<p>At that moment Sandy was aware of a cool,
gentle breeze on the left side of his face. When
Macauley spoke, his voice was tight as a bowstring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s picking up, and it seems to be swinging
around to the southwest. That could mean the fire
will veer smack into this here ridge.... Hey,
you better relay that news back to the fire boss fast.
Maybe they&rsquo;re just wasting their time on that
south line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they realize the wind&rsquo;s shifting?&rdquo; Sandy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not. On account of the elevation here,
we&rsquo;d feel it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macauley handed the boy his flashlight. &ldquo;Here,
better take this so you don&rsquo;t stumble in the dark.
And make it snappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had already returned with a report from
the south line when Sandy stumbled into the
bright lights of the clearing. Jerry was sprawled
out on the grass at the command post while the
ranger phoned his information into headquarters.
Sandy interrupted Dick Fellows excitedly to
announce the unexpected wind shift. And Dick
was even more excited as he told Paul Landers
about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Jerry shook his head skeptically as Sandy
plopped down beside him on the grass. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think that fire is going to change direction. You
should see it down near the middle of the south
line. It&rsquo;s so close now that they can see to work by
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shrugged. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be able to tell for sure
for a while. But that wind is definitely swinging
around and picking up velocity&mdash;by the way,
where&rsquo;s Quiz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry jerked his thumb back across his shoulder.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s back down the line jawing away with
some of the gang bosses. By the time this is over,
he&rsquo;ll be an expert fire fighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Shakespeare to smoke-eating&mdash;that&rsquo;s
our boy. The expert&rsquo;s expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick put the walkie-talkie down and turned
to the boys. &ldquo;Our aerial observer reports a definite
wind shift to the southwest. It&rsquo;s still too early
to notice any effect on the head of the fire, but it&rsquo;s
an important development.&rdquo; He gazed skyward.
&ldquo;Just keep your fingers crossed that it doesn&rsquo;t
really blow up. She&rsquo;d probably crown again and
that could mean spot fires almost anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are spot fires? You mentioned them
before, but you never did explain what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a stiff wind, great masses of flaming embers
and foliage may be carried through the air for
miles and start other fires far ahead of the original
one. That&rsquo;s where the real danger exists for fire
fighters. Lots of times in a bad crown fire, men
have suddenly found themselves completely surrounded
by flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shuddered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s nothing for us to worry about.
We haven&rsquo;t had a big blow up this way in almost
two months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Dick,&rdquo; Jerry asked curiously. &ldquo;Do they
know for sure what started this fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with absolute certainty,&rdquo; the ranger told
him, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet that it was that
lightning storm we had a few days back. Lightning
is by far the leading cause of forest fires in the
United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy yawned and glanced at his watch. &ldquo;Gee,
it&rsquo;s almost midnight,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you guys catch forty winks in the
back of that big van over there,&rdquo; Dick suggested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wake you up if there are any new developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, the walkie-talkie came to life.
Dick conversed briefly with headquarters, then
smiled apologetically at the boys. &ldquo;Sorry, fellows,
but that nap will have to wait. Landers has decided
to hold up setting the backfires on the south
line until we know for sure what&rsquo;s going to
happen with that wind. Jerry, you take the word
on down: Stand by with the flame throwers, but
don&rsquo;t start backfiring until we get confirmation
from headquarters. No sense burning down any
more timber than we have to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, you go down the ridge and tell Macauley
and Roberts that they can start backfiring
any time they&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; the boys said in unison, and started
off in opposite directions.</p>
<p class="tb">It was an eerie sight watching the men fire the
grass with their flame throwers. Rapidly they
moved along the top of the ridge with the cylindrical
tanks strapped to their backs, the long
metal nozzles spewing out jets of blazing gasoline
that consumed everything they touched. Soon the
entire crest was aflame. To the west, a towering
column of smoke spiraled high into the moonlit
sky, the glints of the inferno below shimmering
on its underside. It reminded Sandy of the familiar
mushroom cloud of an atomic blast, and with a
sick feeling he remembered the missing bomb
lying somewhere in these woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER TEN</span>
<br />A Temporary Victory</h2>
<p>Shortly after 3:00 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> Quiz Taylor aroused
Sandy and Jerry, who were asleep in the supply
truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, they need us!&rdquo; he told them excitedly.
&ldquo;The fire has really busted loose again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy sat up groggily, rubbing his eyes.
&ldquo;Whazza matter? Wha&rsquo; happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real southwester blowing up. The
fire has crowned again&mdash;you should see it! She
may leap the ridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leap the ridge!&rdquo; Sandy sat up ramrod-straight,
jolted into full wakefulness. &ldquo;Good night! Let&rsquo;s
go!&rdquo; He and Jerry slipped on their boots and laced
them frantically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The sight that greeted them as they leaped out
of the truck was frightening. To the east, as far as
the eye could see, the canopy of the forest was one
massive sheet of writhing, twisting fire. Long,
forked tongues of flame leaped high into the sky,
whipped about by the strong breeze blowing from
the southwest. The head of the fire had veered off
sharply and was attacking the ridge on a quarter-mile
front which was widening every second.</p>
<p>The boys hurried over to Dick Fellows, who
was talking into the walkie-talkie and scribbling
frantically on a pad. As soon as the conversation
ended, he tore off the sheet he had been writing
on and handed it to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make sure every gang boss on the ridge sees
this,&rdquo; he said tersely. &ldquo;If she crosses the ridge,
they&rsquo;re to pull out their crews at once and retreat
to the road. If this wind keeps up, we might not
even be able to hold her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Sandy was aware of the loose
debris blowing across the clearing. As he took the
paper from the ranger, it almost blew out of his
hand. In the unburned portion of the forest, the
treetops were rustling nervously. It sounded like
a lament, Sandy thought.</p>
<p>Dick looked at Jerry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve pulled most of the
men out of the south line already. Landers feels
that we should abandon it altogether for the
present. Suppose you run down there and notify
them, Jerry. Tell &rsquo;em to report behind the ridge
on the double. They need every man they can
get. Quiz, you stay here in case anything else important
comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Sandy started up the crest of the ridge, but the
ranger called to him, &ldquo;Better circle around in
back. It&rsquo;s pretty hot up there.&rdquo; He looked at the
surface fire advancing slowly through the underbrush
toward the clearing on the flank of the big
blaze. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long before we&rsquo;ll have to get
out of here. Better send back a couple of boys to
move those trucks off the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Sandy said, and circled around behind
the ridge.</p>
<p>The protected slope was teeming with men and
machinery. Bulldozers scurried up and down like
huge beetles, clearing off everything inflammable.
Tank-trucks were moving slowly along the foot
of the slope, their crews sweeping big firehoses
across the face of the forest. Trees were doused
from crown to root. Other smoke-eaters with
hoses were lined up on the crest of the ridge like
soldiers, dwarfed by the monstrous flames that
seemed to arch over them threateningly. Whenever
a flaming bough or a mass of burning foliage
came toppling to the ground nearby, they would
train a jet of fine, foglike spray on it. Watching
this panorama, Sandy was once again impressed
by the fact that the fire behaved at times with what
seemed like animal intelligence. Time and time
again, treacherous fingers of flame would stretch
out to the men, driving them back behind the
safety of the ridge. One such streamer actually did
dart across the crest like a snake, badly burning a
dozer operator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Sandy relayed the communiqu&eacute; from Fire Boss
Landers to all the gang chiefs. He found Ed Macauley
about a half mile down the ridge. His crew
had started to build a hasty fire line at right angles
to the ridge in an attempt to stop the fire racing
down the edge of the forest, but they had finally
abandoned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing short of a miracle will stop her now,&rdquo;
he told Sandy hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything we can do?&rdquo; the boy asked,
his voice tinged with panic.</p>
<p>Macauley shrugged. &ldquo;Not till she runs into the
big firebreaks. There&rsquo;s another road about two
miles north of the ridge; runs east to west. With
enough men we can bottle her up between the two
roads. But she&rsquo;ll burn off better than a thousand
acres before she&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire was now abreast of where they stood on
the crest. A scorching wave of heat swept up the
slope, bringing tears to their eyes, and forcing
them to retreat behind the ridge. No longer did
the men need lights to work by, for the glare of
the flames lit up the countryside with an unearthly
reddish glow.</p>
<p>Sandy was surprised to see Quiz come staggering
breathlessly up to them. He handed Macauley
a message. &ldquo;New plan from headquarters,&rdquo; he
gasped.</p>
<p>Macauley frowned as he read it, then crumpled
the paper up into a ball. &ldquo;Darn waste of time, I
call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Landers wants to give it one more try. We&rsquo;re
going to build a line down at the end of the
ridge.&rdquo; He walked a little way up the slope and
studied the head of the fire driving steadily forward
before the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only got a little more than a half-mile
leeway. We&rsquo;re gonna have to work fast. Need
every man and machine we can spare. C&rsquo;mon, boys,
you&rsquo;re graduating to pick-and-shovel work as of
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The north end of the ridge terminated in a
steep slide of gravel and slag. The proposed fire
line was to extend due west from this rockpile for
at least half a mile. As Macauley pointed out,
everything was against the fire fighters. The
terrain was unsuited to efficient operation of the
dozers and graders; the timber was old and sturdy;
and in places the trees were jammed together so
tightly and their foliage so interlaced that trunks
on opposite sides of the line appeared to have
common crowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this wind,&rdquo; the gang boss predicted, &ldquo;our
backfires won&rsquo;t accomplish a thing. Most likely,
they&rsquo;ll jump the line themselves.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;But
orders is orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Because of the time element, the heavy machinery
just punched helter-skelter through the
woods, and left the cleaning-up to the pick-and-shovel
crews. Behind them came the water wagons,
wetting down the brush and trees on the safe side
of the line.</p>
<p>Quiz Taylor and Sandy Steele were assigned to
a crew of ax men. Jerry James, who had come
along about a half hour later, landed a soft job
manning a hose. But when the overly plump Quiz
collapsed at the side of the trail, Jerry generously
offered to swap jobs with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not permanently, you understand, old boy,&rdquo;
he warned Quiz. &ldquo;Just until you get your wind
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a half hour, Sandy&rsquo;s hands were covered
with blisters and his clothes were plastered to his
body. Sweat poured down his face, blinding him
and caking into mud as it mixed with the dust.
His legs felt as if they were made of cast-iron, and
he could barely lift one foot after the other.</p>
<p>Enviously, he watched Quiz riding on the back
of the water truck. The sight of the fine jet spray
gave him a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Quiz!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Turn that thing on
us for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, son,&rdquo; one of the smoke-eaters said,
and the rest of them picked up the chant. &ldquo;Let
&rsquo;er rip, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Quiz obligingly swerved the nozzle in their direction
and they were engulfed in cooling mist.
Sandy opened his mouth wide and let the water
soothe his swollen tongue and parched throat.
After five minutes of this, they went back to work
with renewed energy.</p>
<p>The line was completed in record time, but
none too soon. The fire front was only about 200
yards away when Macauley gave the order to
backfire. Although the front was less than 1200
feet wide, the flame-thrower crews ignited the
fringe along the line for a full half mile. The boys,
resting with the pick-and-shovel men on the north
tip of the ridge, watched anxiously as the backfires
flared up strong in the dry brush and foliage. Innumerable
times, the flames leaped the line to
attack the trees on the far side, but each time the
dripping wet boughs repulsed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we&rsquo;ll stop her,&rdquo; Sandy said with
elation.</p>
<p>One of the fire fighters shook his head gloomily.
&ldquo;The backfire ain&rsquo;t getting anywhere though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. The backfires were making only
slight progress toward the head of the fire, which
was racing forward with incredible speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; Quiz said hesitantly. &ldquo;I
think the wind is beginning to die down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s your imagination,&rdquo; Jerry said wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; another man exclaimed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
slowing down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Sandy studied the flames closely. He didn&rsquo;t
notice any perceptible difference in the rate of the
fire, but he did notice that the smoke appeared to
be rising in a more nearly vertical direction.
Then, almost miraculously it seemed, the breeze
died abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gosh!&rdquo; Jerry said wonderingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if
somebody turned off a fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz called their attention to the broad band
of silver on the eastern horizon. &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s almost
daylight. That&rsquo;s the answer. It mostly always
calms down at dawn and dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire fighters let out a thunderous cheer that
was picked up all along the fire line. Macauley
came striding up the slope, a big grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the chief outguessed me,&rdquo; he
admitted gleefully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the ebbing of the breeze, the backfire and
the fire head were creeping toward each other
with uniform speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now, boss?&rdquo; Jerry asked. &ldquo;All
go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macauley arched his eyebrows. &ldquo;You kidding,
son? There&rsquo;s still plenty of life in that old devil
yet. She could switch off in another direction any
time. Once we got this front nailed down solid,
we&rsquo;ll attack her from the sides and back. There&rsquo;s
still plenty of digging to be done for those who can
swing a shovel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That definitely lets me out,&rdquo; Quiz groaned. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I could even pick up a shovel, I&rsquo;m so
beat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Macauley stroked his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well,
I gotta admit you boys have done more than a
man&rsquo;s share of work for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sandy protested, even though his knees
were threatening to buckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick it out with
you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Jerry said valiantly.</p>
<p>Macauley smiled. &ldquo;You boys are all right. But
you need to rest. We all do, for that matter.
Suppose you make tracks back to headquarters
and tell the chief to get another crew in here to
relieve us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re sure,&rdquo; Sandy said, with undisguised
relief. &ldquo;I guess we should report back to
Dick Fellows, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was down here himself just a while back,&rdquo;
one of the men volunteered. &ldquo;Looking for you
boys, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go find him,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>By the time they got back to the command post
at the other end of the ridge, it was broad daylight.
Dick Fellows was directing a crew fighting
a small brushfire at the edge of the clearing.
Beyond them the woods was a charred, smoldering
carpet. The tree trunks were blackened and
burned for about ten feet up their trunks; but
the fire had not crowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard you were looking for us,&rdquo; Sandy
announced. &ldquo;We were fighting a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The ranger grinned. &ldquo;So I heard. How do
things look up there? Does Macauley think she&rsquo;ll
hold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his fingers crossed. He wants to know
when his men are going to get some relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick wiped his soot-streaked face with his
sleeve. &ldquo;Just as soon as we can. Landers put a call
out for more volunteers when she took off like
that last night. He had a crew all lined up, but
then a report came in that there was a spot fire up
north about three miles, so he sent the whole
bunch of them to swarm over that one before it
really gets started. It&rsquo;s been a rough night.&rdquo; He
looked around at the men beating out the brushfires
around the clearing. &ldquo;I tell you what, though.
I have about a dozen smoke-eaters mopping up
here and along the south line. Soon as things look
safe, I&rsquo;ll send them down to replace a dozen of the
boys down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men need relief bad,&rdquo; Quiz declared.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re so bushed that they won&rsquo;t be able to
work efficiently for much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;You boys look pretty
bushed yourselves. Why don&rsquo;t you take one of
the jeeps and drive back to headquarters? After
a good meal and a few hours&rsquo; sleep, you&rsquo;ll feel a
lot better.&rdquo; Ominously, he added, &ldquo;We may need
you again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why is everyone so skeptical?&rdquo; Sandy demanded.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe that line will hold
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranger&rsquo;s face was grim. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
on this earth as unpredictable as a forest fire. I
won&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s really out until I personally
squash the last ember under my boot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz stared off into the ravaged grove at the
other side of the clearing. &ldquo;Those trees, will they
die?&rdquo; he asked the ranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tree is like a human being,&rdquo; Dick explained.
&ldquo;It can survive some pretty bad burns, although
it may be scarred badly. Underneath the bark
there&rsquo;s a thin layer of living matter called the
cambium, which can be compared with the underskin
on a human being&mdash;the dermis. If the fire
burns through the outer bark all around the trunk
and kills the cambium, the tree dies. Fortunately,
the bark usually burns through only on the side
of the tree facing the advancing flames. It depends
on the age of the tree and the thickness of the
bark. I think most of those old fellows along the
fringe of the fire will pull through. Not much
chance for any others.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Well, I guess
Sandy and Jerry aren&rsquo;t interested in hearing a
botany lecture right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz smiled wanly. &ldquo;Even <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not interested in
botany right now. Let&rsquo;s go eat, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER ELEVEN</span>
<br />Last-Ditch Stand</h2>
<p>When they reached the main road, Sandy pulled
the jeep up in front of fire headquarters. Prince
came bounding out to meet them, leaping up on
Sandy and barking happily. Then Russ Steele appeared
in the entrance. His face was lined with
weariness and worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hello there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Back from the
wars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just about had it,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;So have
the other fellows on the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ threw one arm across his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;I understand you boys are real hot-shot
smoke-eaters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel like hot shots at
the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hungry!&rdquo; Jerry and Quiz added simultaneously.</p>
<p>Russ laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it. I was just on
my way to chow. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>They walked slowly in the direction of the mess
tent, with Prince trotting at their heels. &ldquo;What
kind of a night did you have, Uncle Russ?&rdquo; Sandy
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spent most of it on the phone and radio. I&rsquo;m
hoarse. Not as rough as you had it, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mr. Landers?&rdquo; Quiz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great! He thrives on this kind of excitement.
What a dynamo that man is. He can talk on six
different phones at once, and play checkers at the
same time. And what he doesn&rsquo;t know about forest
fires wouldn&rsquo;t fill up the eye of a needle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure fooled Macauley,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;He
was certain that last line at the end of the ridge
wouldn&rsquo;t stop the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ frowned. &ldquo;Well, the chief wasn&rsquo;t sure it
would, either. He just had a hunch that that wind
would blow itself out come daylight. He&rsquo;s still not
convinced that they&rsquo;ve stopped her for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; Sandy said moodily. &ldquo;Even the fire boss.
This must be a nerve-racking way to earn a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get any money for fighting fires.
Not these boys anyway. There are exceptions, of
course. Gigantic fires where they can&rsquo;t raise
enough men by the volunteer system. Then they
have to hire them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>At the mess table, their tin plates were heaped
with scrambled eggs, bacon and buttered toast. It
was obvious from their dirty, disheveled appearance
that they had just come off the fire line,
and the cooks besieged them with questions. The
boys talked freely&mdash;and not without pride, Sandy
had to admit to himself. It was a good feeling
being treated as equals by these hard-bitten old
smoke-eaters.</p>
<p>When they were seated cross-legged under a
shady tree, wolfing the food and washing it down
with gulps of hot coffee, Sandy changed the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news on that bomb?&rdquo; he asked his uncle in
a low voice.</p>
<p>Russ shook his head somberly and swallowed a
mouthful of egg. &ldquo;Nothing. I was in touch with
the Pentagon last night, and again this morning.
As you can imagine, they&rsquo;re pretty concerned
about this fire. They offered to send in troops to
help out if it becomes necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they think there&rsquo;s any danger?&rdquo; Quiz asked.
&ldquo;Of the bomb exploding, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ put down his plate and massaged the thick
stubble on his chin. Then he took a pack of cigarettes
from his pocket and lit one. It startled
Sandy, for he knew that his uncle never smoked
cigarettes, except when he was under extreme
tension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t <i>think</i> so,&rdquo; he replied, emphasizing
the verb. &ldquo;But there are so many things we still
don&rsquo;t know about atomic energy. And of course,
there&rsquo;s always the chance the casing was damaged
in some unpredictable way so that&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s only a
billion-in-one chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry suddenly lost his appetite. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just
what they said in the papers that time a comet
landed right in some lady&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a comet, you dope,&rdquo; Quiz said disgustedly.
&ldquo;It must have been a meteorite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glowered at him. &ldquo;So what? It happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ offered Prince the rest of the food in his
plate and the dog gobbled it up eagerly. &ldquo;Well,
speculation won&rsquo;t get us anywhere. The important
thing is to get that fire under control first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz stretched out flat on his back in the dry,
soft grass. &ldquo;The most important thing to me is
sleep. I wouldn&rsquo;t care if an A-bomb went off right
under my nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry snorted. &ldquo;I kept expecting that to happen
all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ smiled. &ldquo;I tell you what. There&rsquo;s a small
brook down the hill a ways. Why don&rsquo;t you go
down there and wash up? Then stretch out on the
pine needles and take a snooze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. He looked at his
watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock now. Wake us up at two&mdash;that
will give us six hours&rsquo; sleep. Unless you
need us for anything, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the worst is over,&rdquo; his uncle assured
him. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll grab some rest myself after I
discuss a few things with the chief.&rdquo; He pushed
himself to his feet and waved to them. &ldquo;See you
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince trotted off faithfully behind him.</p>
<p class="tb">The boys came upon the stream in a shallow
gully about a hundred yards behind the camp.
Like all of the streams they had seen in the
drought-racked forest, it had shrunk to a mere inch
of water gurgling over a pebbly bed. But by
scooping out a basin where the flow was heaviest,
they were able to take a sponge bath. Clean and
refreshed, they stretched out under the small pines
along the bank and fell asleep at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; The urgent cry penetrated Sandy&rsquo;s
consciousness as a rough hand shook him out of a
deep slumber. He opened his eyes and stared up
into the harried face of his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire,&rdquo; Russ Steele said tersely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken
out again. You&rsquo;ll probably be needed. Come up
to headquarters right away.&rdquo; With that, he turned
abruptly and trotted up the slope.</p>
<p>His mind still foggy from sleep, Sandy woke
Jerry and Quiz. And for several minutes the three
boys stared blankly at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; Jerry mumbled.</p>
<p>Sandy was vaguely aware of the wind whistling
through the pines. &ldquo;Sounds like it&rsquo;s blowing up
again&mdash;I guess that&rsquo;s it. Well, let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Quiz asked.</p>
<p>Sandy looked at his watch. &ldquo;A little after one
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragging their feet like zombies, they walked
up the hill to the big tent. Paul Landers and Russ
Steele were bent over the map with three other
men whom Sandy had not seen before.</p>
<p>Russ Steele looked up as the boys entered the
tent. He indicated the three strangers. &ldquo;Fellows,
I&rsquo;d like you to meet Paul Ames, Bill Lukas and
Tom Fenning. They&rsquo;ve come down from Canada
to help us fight this fire. And brought their own
crews with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time, too,&rdquo; Landers said gratefully. &ldquo;If
only I had been able to send in a fresh crew this
morning, we might have been able to avert this
new flare-up. Those poor devils had been working
for seventeen hours without letup; they just
didn&rsquo;t have anything left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy leaned over the map. &ldquo;How did it
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ ran his finger along a red line running
out from the north end of the ridge. &ldquo;It jumped
the emergency line you boys helped to build last
night. Shortly after noon that southwest wind
picked up again and there wasn&rsquo;t any stopping
her this time. It happened so fast, a half dozen of
the men were severely burned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Sandy could see that the fire was already advancing
on a narrow front past the end of the
ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, it&rsquo;s really a brand-new fire,&rdquo; one
of the Canadians said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Fire Boss Landers agreed. He drew
a circle around the burned-out area southwest of
the ridge. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it licked in this sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Canadian studied the map with intense
concentration. &ldquo;As I understand it, this region
north of the ridge is rocky and not too heavily
forested.&rdquo; He touched his index finger to a small
oval representing a hill. &ldquo;Any vegetation growing
on this hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landers shook his head. &ldquo;Scrub and grass. The
same as on the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see any reason why we can&rsquo;t stop
her there.&rdquo; He took a pencil and drew a short line
connecting the hill with the end of the ridge.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll build one line here. And another on the
opposite side.&rdquo; He traced a second line running
east of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can try,&rdquo; Landers said without much
enthusiasm. &ldquo;And if it fails, we&rsquo;ll just have to fall
back and let her burn herself out between the two
big firebreaks.&rdquo; He indicated the intersecting
roads.</p>
<p>The Canadian looked up at his two partners.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste any more time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Russ put a hand on Sandy&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I thought
you boys could ride down there with them and
help out however you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Sandy said, and the other two
boys nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Bill Lukas, the tall, blond Canadian who seemed
to be in charge, flashed his white teeth in a broad
smile. &ldquo;Glad to have you aboard, gentlemen.
We&rsquo;re on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Canadians climbed into the front seat of
a small, squat truck parked outside the tent, while
the boys boosted themselves up on the rear end
and let their legs dangle over the tail gate. As they
started off, Sandy saw his uncle standing in the
entrance with Prince; Russ bent over, spoke to
the dog and gave him a pat on the back. Like a
shot, Prince took off after them. He caught up
with the slow-moving vehicle easily, and with a
graceful leap landed between Sandy and Quiz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see that you stay out of trouble!&rdquo; Russ
yelled to them.</p>
<p>Tom Fenning turned around in the front seat
and grinned. &ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s this? More reinforcements?
He doesn&rsquo;t look much like a firedog to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Doberman pinscher,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>Jerry snickered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s also a confirmed coward.&rdquo;
The dog cocked his head to one side and regarded
Jerry with plaintive eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, you hurt his feelings,&rdquo; Quiz said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Jerry patted Prince&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,
feller. So am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what we hear,&rdquo; Fenning told him.
&ldquo;Mr. Landers says you boys were right in the
thick of it all night. It was pretty rough, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was,&rdquo; Sandy admitted. &ldquo;And discouraging.
When we came back this morning, we
thought it was all over but the shouting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Canadians nodded sympathetically.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fire for you,&rdquo; Lukas said.</p>
<p>Quiz asked the men what had brought them all
the way down from Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good neighbor policy,&rdquo; Fenning said. &ldquo;Your
boys have helped us out on some tough fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the cutoff that led to the fire sector, three
trucks loaded with men and equipment were
parked by the side of the road.</p>
<p>Lukas waved to them as he drove past. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
off, boys. Follow us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they reached the north end of the
ridge, the bulldozers had already started to clear
a fire line to the hill about a third of a mile away.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows and Ed Macauley came forward
listlessly to greet them; the ranger and the gang
boss were too exhausted even to show their gratitude
that relief had finally arrived.</p>
<p>The ranger pointed to the walkie-talkie sitting
on the ground. &ldquo;Landers radioed the new battle
plan to us. We&rsquo;ve got it under way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Lukas said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take over from here.
Your men must be ready to drop in their tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macauley sighed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re working strictly on
nerve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lukas accompanied the ranger up to the top of
the ridge, while the other two Canadians mobilized
their crews to go into action. From this
vantage point, it was possible to trace the course
of the fire since its beginning. With the heavy
screen of foliage destroyed, the boundaries of the
burned-out area were clearly defined. There was a
long narrow strip parallel to the ridge, swelling
out into a sector of more than 300 acres to the
southwest. Only a feeble surface fire was burning
around the fringes of this area now; the stiff gale
was turning the flames back on ground that had
already been burned over.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s first impression was that this latest peril
had been exaggerated. Compared to the awe-inspiring
spectacle of the previous night, the fire
as it appeared now, in broad daylight, didn&rsquo;t seem
very threatening. After it had jumped the line at
the end of the ridge, it had taken an unusual
shape and direction. It had been slowed down in
the center by the thinning timber and brush on
the approaches to the hill beyond the ridge. As a
result, the fire front had flattened out and then assumed
a crescent shape as the flames went racing
through the heavier growth that flanked the hill
on both sides. Sandy estimated that the area it was
burning over was less than fifty acres. When he
pointed this out to Dick Fellows, the ranger shook
his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;The way she&rsquo;s crowning, we&rsquo;d have trouble
confining her on ten acres.&rdquo; He turned to Lukas.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have time to be too particular
with those lines. She&rsquo;s moving in too fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lukas agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get our backfires
started as soon as possible, and just pray that the
tank trucks can put out enough water to keep
<i>them</i> from jumping back at us. That infernal
wind! Why doesn&rsquo;t it let up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz called their attention to a great dark mass
building up low on the western horizon. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
those nimbus clouds?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The ranger studied them uncertainly. &ldquo;They
look like it all right. But don&rsquo;t count on their
doing us any good. I&rsquo;ve spotted nimbus formations
a dozen times this month, but they always drifted
off somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gives with this nimbus business?&rdquo; Jerry
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain clouds,&rdquo; Quiz translated. &ldquo;And they do
seem to be coming in this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lukas winked at the ranger. &ldquo;The whole forest
could burn down while we&rsquo;re waiting for rain. I
better get to work.&rdquo; He waved and started down
the slope toward the fire line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do, Dick?&rdquo; Sandy asked the
ranger. &ldquo;We had about five hours&rsquo; sleep, so we&rsquo;re
ready for action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; Dick muttered, almost reverently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten what the word means.&rdquo; His eyes
were sunken and bloodshot with enormous circles
around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t I take over for you for a while
on the walkie-talkie?&rdquo; Sandy asked. &ldquo;Even if you
only grab a half-hour nap it would help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure would.&rdquo; The idea seemed to appeal to
him. &ldquo;I could stretch out here on the ground,
and if anything important comes up you could
wake me.... The radio is a cinch to operate.
All you have to do is keep headquarters up to date
on what&rsquo;s happening at our end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want us to scout again?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You take the line on one side of the hill;
Quiz can scout the line on the other side. Check
back with Sandy every quarter of an hour or so in
case any new instructions come in from the chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Sandy said, examining
the walkie-talkie radio, &ldquo;is why you don&rsquo;t
have a whole flock of these things all along the fire
line. If every gang boss had one, you&rsquo;d know exactly
what was going on in every sector.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The ranger yawned. &ldquo;Tell it to the taxpayers,
my boy. It&rsquo;s always the things that are most important
to their own safety and welfare that they
gripe most about paying for.... Well, I&rsquo;m going
to rest my tired bones.&rdquo; He stretched out on
the hard, rocky ground and fell asleep immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Quiz,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on the
ball. I&rsquo;ll give you a break and take the line across
the hill, so you won&rsquo;t have to walk so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz snorted. &ldquo;Big deal! Then I&rsquo;m the guy who
has to climb this hill every fifteen minutes to
check in. Unh-uh! I&rsquo;ll flip you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jerry conceded grudgingly. &ldquo;Sandy,
you flip the coin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned as he took a quarter from his
pocket and spun it high in the air. &ldquo;You call,
Quiz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heads!&rdquo; Quiz snapped.</p>
<p>Sandy caught the coin deftly in one hand and
slapped it down on the back of his other hand.
Slowly he uncovered it as Quiz and Jerry bent
over to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tails,&rdquo; he announced blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I win!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;So I pick the far
side of the hill. Don&rsquo;t take it so hard, pal. A little
climbing will help to reduce that spare tire of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz shook his head solemnly as he and Jerry
started down the ridge. &ldquo;Just my luck. I always
call them wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was one of the unluckiest
calls Quiz had ever made in his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER TWELVE</span>
<br />Trapped on the Hill</h2>
<p>Several times during the next hour, Sandy
heard the deep rumble of thunder, and a few
minutes after three o&rsquo;clock, the sun was blotted
out by a low overcast. But the velocity of the wind
had been steadily increasing, and the fire was
raging more fiercely than ever. The backfires had
been completely ineffective, and at three-fifteen,
Jerry came puffing up the hill with the bad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s breached the line. Lukas says there&rsquo;s no
holding her now. They&rsquo;re going to evacuate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time, a sweeping curtain of smoke had
obscured Sandy&rsquo;s view of the fire front. And the
reports he had received over the walkie-talkie from
headquarters indicated that aerial observation was
no better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better wake up Dick,&rdquo; he said. He went
over to the ranger, who was still in a deep sleep,
and shook him violently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Dick Fellows raised himself laboriously on his
elbows and listened glassy-eyed as Sandy told him
the latest development. &ldquo;I knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; he
mumbled. &ldquo;All of it for nothing. In the end she
was bound to beat us.&rdquo; He struggled to his knees.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll notify headquarters. You boys take one last
scout down the line. Make certain all the men get
out safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the bottom of the slope, Sandy turned and
whistled to Prince, who was sniffing curiously at a
half-eaten sandwich in the grass. &ldquo;Better come
with us, boy, so you don&rsquo;t get left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a yelp, the dog trotted after them.</p>
<p>A solid wall of fire blocked the first 600 feet of
the trail that ran to the hill, and they had to detour
more than a hundred yards into the woods.
Machines and men crashed by them on all sides,
hurrying in the opposite direction. As they neared
the hill, they ran into Lukas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you boys going?&rdquo; he asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to make sure that everybody
gets out safely,&rdquo; Sandy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your time,&rdquo; the Canadian said.
&ldquo;All my men are accounted for. We&rsquo;ve lost her for
good this time. She&rsquo;s crowned and running fast on
both flanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better check anyway,&rdquo; Sandy insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get caught on that hill,&rdquo; Lukas warned
them. &ldquo;In another twenty minutes, the flanks will
close and she&rsquo;ll be cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Sandy promised. &ldquo;Come on,
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran on for another quarter of a mile without
encountering anyone else. As they came abreast
of the hill, Sandy stopped. Ahead of them was an
impenetrable curtain of smoke, and beyond it they
could hear the unmistakable crackle of flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better turn back,&rdquo; Sandy said grimly. &ldquo;If
anyone is up there, they&rsquo;re finished anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry did an about-face without breaking step.
&ldquo;All you rabbits get out of the way and make room
for somebody who can really run,&rdquo; he bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that
darn dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably back at headquarters hiding
under a tent flap,&rdquo; Jerry replied cynically. &ldquo;The
big coward. Come on, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; He reached out
and grabbed Sandy&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>The blond boy shook him off. &ldquo;No, Jerry! He
was here a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cupping his hands to his mouth, he began to
shout: &ldquo;Prince! Prin-n-ce! Here, boy!&rdquo; He put
two fingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly.</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Then, from a distance,
they heard the sharp, urgent barking of a dog.</p>
<p>Jerry groaned. &ldquo;Good night! What&rsquo;s he up to
now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Sandy was perplexed. &ldquo;Sounds like he&rsquo;s over by
the hill. But why?&rdquo; Once more, he formed a
megaphone with his hands and called to the dog.
&ldquo;<i>Prince! Come on, boy!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he was answered by a mournful howl.</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice was trembling. &ldquo;Sandy, we&rsquo;ve got
to get out of here. You heard what Lukas said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heat and smoke were stifling now, and the
roar of the fire seemed to surround them.</p>
<p>Still Sandy hesitated. &ldquo;Suppose Prince is hurt,
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here just a minute ago!&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s voice
was frantic. &ldquo;How could he get hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he stepped into a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boy slapped one hand against the side
of his head in exasperation. &ldquo;Oh, brother! Look,
I&rsquo;m leaving, pal.&rdquo; He turned and ran about ten
paces, then looked back across his shoulder.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on,&rdquo; Sandy said stubbornly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
over to the hill and see what&rsquo;s happened to
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy! Come back!&rdquo; Jerry pleaded in desperation,
as his friend disappeared into the thick brush.
He hesitated for just an instant, then ran after
him. &ldquo;Hey, you dope! Wait for me!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Sandy had covered about 200 yards when he
stumbled into ankle-deep water. He vaguely recalled
one of the fire fighters mentioning that a
stream ran around the east side of the hill. He
continued on until he felt the ground rise sharply
beneath his feet. Then he stopped and called out
to the dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Prince! Where are you, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead of him, to the left, he heard loud
barking. He followed the sound and broke out of
the trees onto the abandoned fire line. Glancing
to the left and right along the ten-foot strip, he
saw a solid wall of fire on both sides where the
flames had jumped the line. Roughly 1200 feet
separated the twin fronts, but as the flames raced
through the trees behind the hill, the gap was
closing fast.</p>
<p>Sandy started as Prince&rsquo;s head burst out of a
thicket across the path from him. &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo;
he said with relief. &ldquo;What are you doing way over
here? Come on, we&rsquo;ve got to get out of the woods
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince barked and backed into the thicket
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stupid dog! <i>Come here!</i>&rdquo; Sandy yelled.
In a frenzy of anger, he dropped down on his
hands and knees and charged into the thicket after
the dog. He had gone about five feet when he came
upon Prince standing over the still form of Quiz
Taylor sprawled out on the ground. From the fire
line he had been completely hidden by the thick
foliage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Sandy had a moment of overwhelming panic
and confusion. Behind him, he heard Jerry calling
to him. &ldquo;Over here, Jerry,&rdquo; he shouted as he stood
up in the waist-deep brush.</p>
<p>Jerry stared at him incredulously from the
center of the path. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quiz,&rdquo; Sandy said weakly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s unconscious.
Give me a hand. We&rsquo;ve got to carry him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry turned pale. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; He struggled
through the bushes to Sandy&rsquo;s side and stared bug-eyed
at Quiz. &ldquo;Is he alive? What happened to
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s alive. But I don&rsquo;t know what
happened to him. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Prince&mdash;&rdquo;
He didn&rsquo;t finish the statement, but Jerry knew
what he meant.</p>
<p>The boys managed to get Quiz on his feet, and
by slinging one of his arms around each of their
necks, they were able to drag him along between
them. Their progress was painfully slow. Every
few feet, vines, bushes and other impediments
would snag on Quiz&rsquo;s feet. And both Jerry and
Sandy were physically exhausted from the night
before. They had only gone as far as the stream
when it became obvious to Sandy that the dead
weight of the stout boy was too much for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never make it, Jerry,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;The
fire will get us for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was on the verge of panic. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?
We can&rsquo;t leave him here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Sandy looked around frantically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only
got one chance. The hill. Maybe we can signal to
the helicopter from the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shook his head in despair. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never
spot us through all this smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; Sandy insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only
chance. I heard one of the rangers say that forest
fires often leave one side of a hill untouched.&rdquo;
Abruptly, his eyes fell on Prince, who was standing
in the shallow water, whimpering and trembling.
&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; He rummaged in
his pockets until he found the stub of a pencil.
&ldquo;You got anything I can write on, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a piece of paper that&rsquo;s blank on one
side.&rdquo; Jerry handed him a folded sheet on which
Dick Fellows had scribbled a message the night
before.</p>
<p>Sandy crouched down, and spreading the paper
flat on his leg, he began printing in big block
letters:</p>
<p class="center">TRAPPED ON HILL. SEND HELP. SANDY</p>
<p>When he had finished the message, he sat down
and began to unlace one boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the heck are you doing?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I need the lace to fasten this note to Prince&rsquo;s
collar. The way he travels, he can make it out of
here easily. If the note gets to Uncle Russ&mdash;or
anybody for that matter&mdash;maybe they can notify
the &rsquo;copter pilot that we&rsquo;re on the hill. You&rsquo;ve seen
how they perform air rescues in the movies,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice wasn&rsquo;t too hopeful. &ldquo;Sure. They
drop rope ladders or slings. But by the time they
get this note&mdash;if they <i>ever</i> do&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be fried to a
crisp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took all of Sandy&rsquo;s will power to force a feeble
grin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come out of this, pal. The most
important thing to remember when you&rsquo;re in a
tight spot, Uncle Russ says, is to stay calm and
cool; if you use your head there&rsquo;s mostly always a
way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your breath, Sandy. I&rsquo;m so scared I could
blubber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy folded the paper several times until it
was a tight little wad. Then he called the dog over
to him. Wedging the paper into the leash ring on
Prince&rsquo;s leather collar, he bound it securely in
place with the long thong from his boot. He took
the Doberman&rsquo;s slender muzzle between his two
hands and looked straight into the intelligent
brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he said slowly, emphasizing each
word. &ldquo;Go ... to ... Uncle Russ ... Uncle
Russ ... Understand? ... Find Uncle Russ
... That&rsquo;s the boy.&rdquo; He turned Prince around in
the opposite direction and gave him a pat on the
rump. &ldquo;Go, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>With a parting yelp, Prince streaked out of
sight into the forest.</p>
<p>The crackle of the fire was louder now, and they
could see it advancing through the treetops on
both sides of them. The sky was completely blotted
out by smoke, creating an artificial dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get back to the hill,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we soak ourselves in the
stream?&rdquo; Jerry suggested. &ldquo;I heard somewhere that
you can protect yourself from the heat and flying
embers that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. &ldquo;Maybe the cold
water will revive Quiz too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys stretched out full length in the
sluggish stream, turning over and over until their
clothing was soaked back and front. Last of all,
they pulled Quiz into the stream, splashing water
on his face and head.</p>
<p>For the first time since they had found him, he
showed signs of life&mdash;a soft moan and a fluttering
of his eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a lump the size of an egg on his head,&rdquo;
Sandy pointed out. He scooped up a handful of
wet mud from the bed of the stream and plastered
it on the swelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s coming to,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>Gradually, the injured boy&rsquo;s eyes opened; they
stared blankly into space for a few moments, then
focused on the anxious faces hovering over him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy ... Jerry ...&rdquo; he said weakly. &ldquo;Was
I asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were out cold,&rdquo; Sandy told him. He
touched the lump on Quiz&rsquo;s head gingerly. &ldquo;Something
must have conked you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recollection flooded back to Quiz. &ldquo;I climbed
a tree to see if I could get a better look at the fire.
A branch broke and that&rsquo;s about all I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel strong enough to walk?&rdquo; Sandy
asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; Suddenly his hands went to his
eyes. &ldquo;My glasses! Where are they? I can&rsquo;t see two
feet ahead of me without my glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy winced. &ldquo;I picked them up, Quiz. But
I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to do you much good.&rdquo;
He reached into his shirt pocket and took out a
pair of woeful-looking eyeglasses. The frames were
twisted like a pretzel and the lenses were spiderwebbed
with tiny shatters.</p>
<p>Quiz accepted them glumly. By twisting and
bending the pliable frames, he was finally able to
wear them, though they perched on his nose at a
rakish angle. In spite of their predicament, Sandy
and Jerry had to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a cockeyed owl,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody asked you,&rdquo; Quiz growled. He
squinted through the shattered lenses. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like
looking through cheesecloth. But it&rsquo;s better than
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>A blast of scorching air hit Sandy on the side
of his face. Because of the smoke and the thickness
of this portion of the woods, it was impossible
to tell exactly how far away the fire was, but he
knew it couldn&rsquo;t be too far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys, we&rsquo;ve got to get back to the
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz&rsquo;s mind was still a bit hazy. &ldquo;Hill?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;You mean the ridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly Sandy described how the fire had out-flanked
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re cut off,&rdquo; Jerry said with a note of doom
in his voice. &ldquo;Surrounded by fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz swallowed hard. &ldquo;There must be <i>something</i>
we can do.&rdquo; He snapped his fingers as a
thought hit him. &ldquo;Wait a minute! Macauley&rsquo;s
men left a pile of shovels, hoes and picks behind
when they were relieved by the Canadians. We can
clear a line in the grass on this side of the hill and
start a backfire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; Sandy said. He led
the way out of the forest, which ended about ten
yards beyond the abandoned fire line. Directly
ahead, the hill rose up like an oversized haystack.</p>
<p>Quiz pointed to a stack of digging implements
off to one side. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the stuff I was telling you
about. But first let&rsquo;s go up to the top and have a
look around.&rdquo; He started up the steep, grassy slope
that ran up about 200 feet to the summit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The top of the hill was littered with rocks of all
sizes and shapes. The boys scrambled up on an
enormous boulder, where they had a bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of the surrounding countryside. Up here, the
force of the wind was so great that they had to
crouch on hands and knees to keep from being
toppled over. On the west slope, a slow but determined
grass fire was burning all around the
base of the hill. But they had never seen anything
to match the fury of the crown fire raging all
around them. A quarter of a mile behind the hill,
the twin fronts had finally united, sealing off the
last corridor of escape. They were now literally
isolated on an island in the midst of a sea of flame.
A shifting current of air sent a hail of hot coals
and blazing twigs raining down on the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; Jerry beat out a spark that was sizzling
on the wet material of his pants.</p>
<p>Smoke spiraled up from several spots on the
grassy slope away from the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Sandy yelled, leaping off the
boulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to beat those out before they
really get started.&rdquo; He ran down the slope to the
nearest place where the grass was smoldering and
stomped on the sparks with his boots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Jerry went to another danger spot farther down
the slope, while Quiz spotted one in a patch of
heavy brush far to the left. As Quiz leaped feet-first
into the bushes, Sandy, who was looking in
that direction, was startled to see his friend unexpectedly
disappear as if the earth had swallowed
him. He heard the rattle of falling earth and
stones, followed by a cry of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiz!&rdquo; he shouted in alarm, and started over
in that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</span>
<br />An Unexpected Find</h2>
<p>With relief, he heard Quiz&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Watch your
step! There&rsquo;s a big hole over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy advanced cautiously to the rim of a crater
hidden in the high brush. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; he said
anxiously, as Quiz&rsquo;s head poked into view. &ldquo;This
is your unlucky day. Did you hurt yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I sprained my ankle.&rdquo; The other boy
held up his hand. &ldquo;Give me a lift, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry came up and the two of them dragged
poor Quiz out of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how do you suppose that got here?&rdquo;
Sandy said.</p>
<p>Quiz shrugged. &ldquo;Looks like a meteorite crater.
Anyway, it really wasn&rsquo;t such bad luck my falling
into it. It&rsquo;s the perfect place for us to wait out the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;We build our fire line right around the circumference.
Clear a strip about two feet wide out
from the edge and start a backfire. It&rsquo;s deep
enough so that even if the whole hill goes up,
we&rsquo;ll be protected from the heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea, Quiz!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed,
pounding him on the back. &ldquo;You wait here while
Jerry and I go down and bring up some of those
shovels and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Quiz to nurse his injured ankle, the
other two boys hot-footed it down the slope to
the mound of equipment the fire fighters had left
behind. Sandy gathered up a shovel and two picks.
&ldquo;Grab a couple of those Pulaski hoes,&rdquo; he told
Jerry. Tears streamed out of his eyes from the
smoke, and Jerry was seized with a coughing spell
that almost choked him. The heat was unbearable
as the fire closed in on the hill.</p>
<p>Staggering up the slope again with their load,
they dumped the tools at the edge of the crater.
For a few minutes, they were too breathless to
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so pooped in my life,&rdquo; Jerry
gasped. &ldquo;Even after four quarters of football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lack of oxygen,&rdquo; Quiz theorized. &ldquo;The fire
steals it out of the air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Sandy remembered a dreadful story he had
heard about a dozen men who had taken shelter
in a cave in the midst of a forest fire. The fire
hadn&rsquo;t touched them, but they had all died nevertheless.
The fire had exhausted all the oxygen
in the cave in the same way that a candle will
when it burns under a glass bell in a laboratory
experiment. He was glad that this was an open
pit high on the side of a hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better get started,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Quiz
has a bad leg, Jerry, so you and I will do the heavy
work. Quiz do you think you can follow us up
with a hoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Quiz said promptly. &ldquo;I think the
old ankle will hold up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They worked in a frenzy, fear and desperation
lending them strength and endurance that Sandy
had never realized they had. Only minutes before,
he had felt he was too weary to lift an ax, much
less swing one in such tireless fashion. In less than
twenty minutes, they had cleared a broad ribbon
around the rim of the crater.</p>
<p>The hill was ringed in flames now. Below them
the fire swept through the grass from the wood
line and started up the slope. The sparse growth
on the crest was ablaze, and on either side a dozen
little spot fires, ignited by flying embers, spread
and merged.</p>
<p>Sandy jumped down into the loose sand and
gravel of the crater. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you guys! Let&rsquo;s
shovel this stuff up all around the edges to form a
barricade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Grabbing a shovel, he plunged it into the sand.
There was a dull <i>clank</i> of metal jarring against
metal, about two inches below the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; he exclaimed, feeling the impact
vibrate through the handle into his hands. &ldquo;What
did I hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a chest of pirate gold,&rdquo; Jerry suggested,
leaping into the hole after Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bright boy,&rdquo; Quiz said sarcastically. &ldquo;Maybe
Captain Kidd sailed all the way to Red Lake to
bury his booty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry dropped to their knees and
began scooping the loose earth away from the
spot with their hands. Quickly they uncovered the
edge of what seemed to be a flat sheet of metal.
They continued digging until they had uncovered
enough of the object for Sandy to get a grip on it.
He pulled and tugged, but it was immovable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only a small piece of whatever it is,&rdquo;
he said finally. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s buried pretty deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz, who had come up behind them, was studying
the exposed metal with keen interest. &ldquo;Dig
some more,&rdquo; he told them.</p>
<p>As the boys pawed away at the earth like dogs,
the strange object began to assume form&mdash;a
vaguely familiar form, Sandy thought. It was
coated with a heavy, dull green paint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good night!&rdquo; Quiz whispered suddenly.
&ldquo;You know what that looks like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>At that instant the same idea must have struck
both Sandy and Jerry, for they stopped digging
and looked up with stricken expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a fin&mdash;a fin on the tail of a bomb!&rdquo;
Sandy said tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s voice cracked. &ldquo;Or
could it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz adjusted his smashed glasses and peered
more closely at the mysterious object. &ldquo;It could
be and it <i>is</i>! That&rsquo;s a fin all right. I saw a newsreel
once showing a demolition squad removing a dud
bomb from a meadow in England; it had been
there ever since World War Two. And it was lying
half-buried in a crater just like this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry began to back away as if he were confronting
a poisonous snake. &ldquo;Imagine sitting on an
A-bomb, fellows! We gotta do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked around grimly at the flames converging
on them. &ldquo;Right now we&rsquo;re in a lot more
danger from that fire than we are from any bomb.
Come on, Jerry, let&rsquo;s get busy with the shovels.
Quiz, you start lighting the backfires. I picked up
a signal flare down below along with these tools.
It&rsquo;s over by the hoes. You should be able to ignite
this dry grass easily with that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>With the backfires blazing strongly around the
parapet of earth that Sandy and Jerry had erected
along the rim of the pit, the boys arranged themselves
in a prone position in the center of the pit.
Its sides shielded them from the direct blast of the
flames, and the earth they were lying on was cool
and comforting. As an added precaution against
flying embers, they covered themselves from foot
to neck with sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know how a mole feels,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a mole,&rdquo; Jerry answered. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t stop burrowing until I reached China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz heaved a handful of sand at a burning
brand that had dropped a few feet away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you&rsquo;re so worried about. We&rsquo;re as snug
and safe here as three bugs in a rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four bugs in a rug,&rdquo; Jerry amended gravely.
&ldquo;You forgot the bomb. For all we know that baby
might be all set to blow this very minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Quiz scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so silly,&rdquo; Jerry defended his position.
&ldquo;You heard what General Steele said. Anything is
possible. Even he couldn&rsquo;t predict what might
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I wonder what Uncle Russ is doing right
now. He&rsquo;s probably wondering how he&rsquo;s going
to break the news to our folks,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Prince got to him with that note?&rdquo;
Jerry wanted to know.</p>
<p>Sandy shrugged. &ldquo;Even if he did, Uncle Russ
must think we&rsquo;re fried to a crisp by now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Quiz gazed affectionately at the exposed tip of
the bomb&rsquo;s fin. &ldquo;We might have been too, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for this lovely hole. We never could
have dug it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy raised his head and sniffed. &ldquo;I wonder
how the fire is coming? Doesn&rsquo;t it sound as if it&rsquo;s
letting up a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoke&rsquo;s not so thick,&rdquo; Quiz admitted.
&ldquo;Want to take a look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; Sandy sat up, dumping the dirt off
himself. &ldquo;You fellows stay in your cocoons.&rdquo;
Slowly he got to his feet and looked around.</p>
<p>On all sides of the crater, the ground was black
and smoking and littered with glowing embers.
But only in a few places were there still tongues
of flame licking up. The hill had been burned
clean, but the danger was over. Sandy felt his
knees go wobbly with relief. The forest was still
blazing fiercely all around them, but they were
safe now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve made it, fellows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All
we&rsquo;ve got to do now is wait for somebody to come
and rescue us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next half hour, the boys watched the fire
spreading through the forest to the east. Several
times Sandy ventured out of the pit, but the
burned ground seared his feet even through his
thick-soled boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think it&rsquo;ll be before they find
us?&rdquo; Jerry asked impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo; A new thought struck Sandy.
&ldquo;You know, maybe they don&rsquo;t even know we&rsquo;re
missing. There must be so much confusion back at
headquarters, that Uncle Russ probably hasn&rsquo;t
had time to give us a thought. He may think we&rsquo;re
somewhere along the road working with one of the
crews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll be able to stop her at the
road?&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll bottle her up between the two big
firebreaks,&rdquo; Quiz said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s still going to be
a major catastrophe. All that beautiful timber going
up in smoke&mdash;enough wood to build an entire
city, Macauley says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just so <i>we</i> didn&rsquo;t go up in smoke,&rdquo; Jerry
said. &ldquo;Along with our friend back there....
Doesn&rsquo;t it give you the cold shivers to think that
you&rsquo;re sitting on top of an atomic bomb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Quiz denied. &ldquo;As a matter of
fact, I&rsquo;d like to dig the thing out and see what it
looks like. We can&rsquo;t tell anything about it from
that little tip of the fin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry stared at Quiz as if he were crazy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
dig alone, friend. And wait until I&rsquo;m at least a
thousand miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz shook his head despairingly. &ldquo;Jerry,
where&rsquo;s your scientific curiosity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what curiosity did?&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>Sandy motioned for them to be quiet. &ldquo;Listen;
hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The throb of engines came to them through the
smoky overcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a chopper,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>Soon it was directly overhead and building up
in volume. Unexpectedly a big helicopter broke
out of the smoke less than fifty feet above them.
The boys leaped up and down, waving their arms
and shouting. Even Quiz hopped about on his one
good leg. The figures in the glass-enclosed cockpit
were clearly visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Uncle Russ!&rdquo; Sandy yelled.</p>
<p>The great rotor blades churned the air like the
wings of a giant bird as the ship braked its descent
about twenty-five feet above the pit and hung
motionless in air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not going to land, are they?&rdquo; Jerry
looked concerned. &ldquo;It will squat right on top of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to his question, a hatch in the underside
of the plane slid open and a Jacob&rsquo;s ladder
was let down slowly. A man&rsquo;s voice blasted out of
the &rsquo;copter&rsquo;s special loud-speaker system:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Russ Steele.... Are you all okay?... Just
nod your heads, I can&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo; The
boys nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Good! Think you can
all make it up the ladder?... Still too hot down
there to try a landing.&rdquo; Sandy and Jerry nodded,
then pointed to Quiz&rsquo;s ankle with elaborate
gestures. &ldquo;Quiz can&rsquo;t make the climb?... Well,
Quiz, do you think you can hold on while we reel
you in?&rdquo; Quiz nodded his head affirmatively.
&ldquo;Fine. Sandy and Jerry, you two come on up first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladder was dangling right before their
noses now. Sandy took a long breath and put his
left foot on the first wooden rung, grasping the
rope sides firmly. &ldquo;Here I go,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And go he did! Without warning, a gust of
wind caught the &rsquo;copter and lifted it ten feet in the
air. Sandy, clinging for his life to the ladder, went
sailing up and out in a wide arc. Back and forth
he swung like an acrobat on a high trapeze. Below
him the ground swirled sickeningly and he
squeezed his eyes tight shut. Uncle Russ&rsquo;s voice
rang in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hold tight! You&rsquo;ll be all right.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung and spun in diminishing circles until
finally the ladder was still. Then he began to climb
as fast as he dared, praying that the wind wouldn&rsquo;t
play any more tricks on him. At last, strong arms
reached down to pull him through the hatch into
the plane, and he collapsed on the floor, temporarily
speechless. The most he could manage was
a weak smile of assurance for his uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Russ Steele had aged ten years since Sandy had
seen him earlier that afternoon. He put both
hands on Sandy&rsquo;s shoulders and squeezed so hard
the boy winced. &ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re safe,&rdquo; he said
gratefully. &ldquo;When I read that note&mdash;&rdquo; His voice
choked. &ldquo;Prince was nagging at me for over an
hour before I spotted that paper in his collar.
Look, we&rsquo;ll talk about it later. I&rsquo;ve got to get those
other boys up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, Sandy had recovered
sufficiently to crawl over to the hatch and watch
Jerry make the precarious ascent. This time the
&rsquo;copter behaved itself, but Jerry had a great deal
of difficulty mastering the Jacob&rsquo;s ladder. Every
time he raised a foot and placed it on another
rung, foot and ladder would swing out and up
and Jerry would find himself hanging parallel
to the ground. Russ Steele yelled to him through
the loud-speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, use your arms! Lift with your arms
and push with your feet at the same time. They&rsquo;ve
got to work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky thing I&rsquo;ve been on those ladders before,&rdquo;
Sandy observed sympathetically. &ldquo;Poor
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jerry was eventually pulled aboard without
any accident and lay puffing and wheezing on the
floorboards like a beached whale.</p>
<p>Quiz had the easiest ascent of all, standing on
the bottom rung of the ladder while it was hauled
up to the plane.</p>
<p>Then the &rsquo;copter&rsquo;s engines roared and it went
leaping into the sky like a big grasshopper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</span>
<br />The Rains Came</h2>
<p>Because of this latest emergency, Fire Boss
Landers had moved his headquarters about two
miles down the road to the junction of the two big
firebreaks. Over four hundred smoke-eaters were
strung out along this line. Twice they had fought
the fire on its own terms in the thick forest and
had had victory within their grasp&mdash;only to see it
get away from them. Now, tired and discouraged,
they had retreated to strong defensive positions
established years before for just such an emergency.
They would wait until the fire came to
them, hurling itself against the firebreaks as a wild
beast throws itself against the bars of its cage. They
would watch its struggles become weaker and
weaker until, at last, it would burn itself out. But
in some vague, intangible way, they felt that the
fire had really won the battle. For it would be
hundreds of years before man and nature could
rebuild what the fire had destroyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The remarkable escape of the boys was the only
heartening note in camp that second night of the
forest fire. Time and time again, they had to
repeat the dramatic story for new audiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to strike medals for the lot of
you,&rdquo; Paul Landers declared enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might just do that,&rdquo; Russ Steele
mumbled under his breath, just loud enough for
his nephew to hear. As soon as the rescue plane
had landed them back at headquarters, Sandy had
pulled his uncle aside for a private conversation.
Minutes later a carefully worded telegram was on
its way to the Pentagon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="small">FIRE STILL RAGING UNCHECKED HERE AT RED
LAKE BUT WE PLUCKED OUR HOT POTATO OUT
BEFORE IT WAS TOO BADLY BURNED</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The local telegrapher must be really scratching
his head over that one,&rdquo; Russ said with a
laugh, as he and the boys sat around in a circle on
the ground eating supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens now?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Air Force will fly a top-security demolition
team up here pronto. Probably tomorrow
morning. The bomb will be dismantled and that
will be the end of it.... I don&rsquo;t have to tell you
boys that the government owes you a debt of
enormous gratitude for finding its &lsquo;hot potato.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t exactly find it.
More accurately, we stumbled over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> stumbled over it,&rdquo; Quiz corrected, patting
his ankle, now tightly strapped with elastic bandage.
&ldquo;But as I pointed out to Sandy and Jerry
before, General Steele, we owe our lives to the fact
that the bomb fell where it did. If we hadn&rsquo;t had
that hole to crawl into, there might have been
three well-done potatoes on that hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ranger Dick Fellows approached them with his
plate and coffee mug. &ldquo;Mind if I join you
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Russ invited him. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if she&rsquo;ll lay waste the entire area due
east and due north of the end of the ridge between
the two roads. All we can do now is concentrate on
the flanks. If that wind should reverse itself, she
might burn clear back to the river before we could
stop her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys let out a long groan. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Sandy
said with disbelief. &ldquo;That couldn&rsquo;t happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time,&rdquo; Dick said pessimistically.
&ldquo;Fire in Idaho played tag with the fire
fighters for three days. Burned off thirty thousand
acres before it was controlled by&mdash;&rdquo; In the middle
of the sentence, he stopped and cocked his head to
one side. &ldquo;Say, do you hear what I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Sandy became aware of a loud rustling in the
heavy foliage overhead. &ldquo;Sounds as if the wind is
picking up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind nothing!&rdquo; To the amazement of Russ
Steele and the three boys, Dick Fellows unexpectedly
threw his mess tin high into the air and
let out an ear-splitting Indian yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy smokes!&rdquo; Jerry said, edging back from
the ranger. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s blown his stack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy heard the deep rumble of thunder, and
then he felt the <i>splat</i> of a raindrop on the top of
his head, followed by another and another. Soon
they were falling all around him, making little
pockmarks in the dry dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain!&rdquo; Jerry said in an awed voice.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows was nearly hysterical. &ldquo;Rain!&rdquo; he
repeated. And before Jerry could stop him, he had
snatched <i>his</i> plate away and tossed it into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hungry?&rdquo; Sandy cried gleefully and
sent his meat loaf and mashed potatoes soaring. As
if at a signal, the other fire fighters who were eating
in the grove followed suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell which it&rsquo;s raining harder,&rdquo; Quiz
said, &ldquo;gravy or water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Prince and a few other stray dogs who had attached
themselves to the camp were having a field
day, scampering around gobbling up the discarded
food. The road was crowding up fast with men
leaping about with their faces turned to the sky.
This was a rain to end all rain. It was almost as
if the sky had been filling up during all the weeks
of the drought and finally had burst open like a
balloon, dumping its whole reservoir onto the
parched earth in one big splash.</p>
<p>Sandy saw men dancing together in a knee-deep
rivulet running down a culvert at the side of the
road. He saw one man scoop up a handful of mud
and throw it at another man like a kid with a
snowball.</p>
<p>Fire Boss Landers was standing by himself very
quietly, his face turned up to the sky, and Sandy
had a feeling that tears were running down his
cheeks along with the raindrops.</p>
<p>Dick Fellows grabbed Sandy by the arm and
pointed to a gigantic cloud almost a mile wide
that was rising and spreading across the forest
to the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; Sandy asked fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steam!&rdquo; the ranger bawled happily. &ldquo;What
we couldn&rsquo;t do in two days, nature has done in a
matter of minutes. The fire&rsquo;s done for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy saw his uncle walking slowly in the direction
of the headquarters tent. &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo; he called after him.</p>
<p>Russ turned and grinned back at them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you guys know enough to come in out of the
rain?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</span>
<br />End of the Trail</h2>
<p>Sleeping in a pup tent was out of the question
that night. Ankle-deep mud covered the ground
as the rain continued unabated. Russ Steele
bunked in with Paul Landers and the boys were
invited to use three empty cots in one of the
Canadian squad tents. It was pleasant sitting
around in a circle on the cots by the dim light of
an oil lamp, hearing the drops pelt and drum on
the canvas sides of the tent. They shared these
quarters with two older men who were veterans
of a thousand outdoor adventures, and their
stories held the boys spellbound.</p>
<p>But by ten o&rsquo;clock none of them could keep
their eyes open, and they put out the light and
rolled up in their blankets. For nine hours, Sandy
slept the deep, untroubled sleep of exhaustion
until his uncle shook him gently awake the next
morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time to break camp,&rdquo; Russ told him. &ldquo;The
helicopter pilot is going to give us a free ride back
to Red Lake. I don&rsquo;t imagine Quiz will be able to
do much walking on that bad leg for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the only one,&rdquo; Sandy groaned. &ldquo;I feel
about ninety years old. Every muscle in my body
aches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll loosen up once you start moving
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next cot, Jerry pushed himself up drowsily
on one elbow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> be the same again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele laughed. &ldquo;Hey now, that&rsquo;s no way
to talk. You boys have almost three weeks of your
vacation to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Jerry squawked. &ldquo;It feels as though
we&rsquo;ve been living in the woods all our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much for you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck, no!&rdquo; Jerry said hastily. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
traded a minute of it for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the couple of hours we camped on the
hill with that bomb?&rdquo; Sandy asked slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; Jerry maintained. &ldquo;Only if
it&rsquo;s all the same to you guys. I&rsquo;d just as soon spend
the next couple of weeks camped smack in the
middle of Red Lake aboard that nifty power
launch&mdash;with plenty of water all around me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy that,&rdquo; Sandy agreed.</p>
<p>Russ Steele nodded. &ldquo;You can swim, fish and go
water skiing. And explore the lake. It&rsquo;s pretty big,
you know. Some day, we can cruise down to the
lower lake and visit the Indian Reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Sandy looked around to make sure
that their Canadian tent-mates were not around.
&ldquo;What about the bomb? Are we just going to take
off and leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s under control,&rdquo; Russ assured
him. &ldquo;A special military detail arrived at dawn to
expedite that matter. You&rsquo;ll be relieved to learn
that there is no trace of radioactivity in the area
whatsoever. Evidently, the casing was not
shattered by the impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiz woke up just in time to hear the last part
of the conversation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Last night I
dreamed that I glowed in the dark like the radium
numbers on a watch face. What a nightmare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Jerry said brightly. &ldquo;Just think, you
could read in the dark by the light of your nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy swung his feet around to give Jerry&rsquo;s cot
a hard shove. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think it was so funny
yesterday, old buddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russ Steele stood up. &ldquo;Get a move on, boys.
We don&rsquo;t want to miss that plane ride back to the
lodge. I&rsquo;ll meet you over at the mess tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were dressing, Quiz began to speak
self-consciously. &ldquo;You know, I never did get a
chance to thank you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry exchanged puzzled looks.
&ldquo;Thank us for what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know,&rdquo; Quiz said gruffly. &ldquo;I mean you
two wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped by the fire if you
hadn&rsquo;t come back to look for me. Well, you risked
your lives to save me. I don&rsquo;t know quite how to
say it, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; Sandy cut in, bending over
quickly to tie his shoelace. &ldquo;Have it engraved on
a medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solid gold,&rdquo; Jerry added. &ldquo;None of this cheap
gold-plated stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, wait a minute!&rdquo; Quiz roared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying
to be serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On second thought,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;the town of
Valley View might have given us a gold <i>cup</i> if we
hadn&rsquo;t bothered.&rdquo; He ducked as Quiz heaved a
shoe at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good old Pepper,&rdquo; Jerry mused. &ldquo;He sure will
feel bad that <i>you</i> got off that hill, Sandy. Just
imagine, that would have left the quarterback slot
on the school team wide open for him this fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; Sandy sat up straight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right, summer is practically over. In less than three
weeks, the new term starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry slumped forward sadly on the edge of his
cot. &ldquo;You know what I just did? I just went and
ruined the rest of my vacation.&rdquo; He sniffed as the
smell of frying bacon drifted into the tent. &ldquo;But
not my appetite. Come on, you guys, let&rsquo;s go to
chow.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
